BENVENUTO CELLINI ARTIST AND WRITER BY ROYAL CORTISSOZ N"La Cousine Bette" Balzac has an illuminating note on one phase of the artistic temperament. He is speaking of Wenceslas Steinbock,the sculptor, and of the way in which his statue of Marshal Montcornet somehow fails to get itself turned into a masterpiece. Describing the Pole as wasting a large proportion of his time in talk- ing about the statue instead of working at it, he thus continues: "He talked admirably about art,and in the eyes of the world he maintained his reputation as a great artist by his powers of conversation and criti- cism. There are many clever men in Paris who spend their lives in talking themselves out, and are content with a sort of drawing-room celebrity. ... At the same time, these half artists are delightful ; men like them and cram them with praise ; they even seem su- perior to the true artists, who are taxed with conceit, unsociableness, contempt of the laws of society. "Ben- venuto Cellini was a kind of Steinbock. He had an im- mense amount of energy, but he did not concentrate it and send it through the right channels with the de- voted instin6l of the great artist.The parallel is not to be overdone. Indeed, if we carry it too far, it is bound to break down, for Cellini was every inch a man, and there is a deplorably effeminate weakness about C * 1

BENVENUTO CELLINI Wenceslas. But there is no denying that where thte Italian was vulnerable was in just that foible whiclh Balzac, in his penetrating way, hits off so well. Hte talked too much. He was of too impulsive a habit tco make immortal statues. There was too much vehe-;- mence about him, he used too many gestures, ancd it seems the most natural thing in the world that hks fame should be preserved in a work of literaturee rather than in a work of art. The Autobiography ias his best monument, better even than the Perseus*. Nevertheless, it is a mistake to allow this fa6l to ob- scure the very interesting question of his relation tco Italian art. Too often has eagerness to get at thee Autobiography inclined writers to pass indifferently over Cellini's achievements as a goldsmith and sculp^- tor. It is true that M. Plon's book does not err im this direction, and that only eight years ago Mr*. C. R. Ashbee took the pains to translate Cellini'ss technical "Trattati," and to print his version in lux- urious form. But when the Autobiography is at alll to the fore it seems to abate discussion of the things for which Cellini himself had, after all, the most con- cern. I think it is worth while, therefore, to speak oif those things on the present occasion. One of the most delightful of the many paradoxess of the Italian Renaissance is its treatment of the pro- fessional idea. Never was there a time in which mem were keener on preserving the integrity of their vari- ous guilds; the youth apprenticed to anyone of the nu- merous branches of art that had then each its clearly^ C xii J

ARTIST AND WRITER fixed status was impelled by all the influences of the period to make the independence and the importance of his chosen branch a point of honour. It was a time of intense personal pride. Yet it was a time, too, of extraordinary give and take in the arts. The archi- tect and the sculptor, for example, met one another halfway. It is significant that in the very dawn of plastic art in Italy it is an entirely utilitarian project that stirs creative genius to activity. It is as an archi- tect, no less than as a sculptor, that Niccola Pisano undertakes to construct the hexagonal pulpit for the baptistery at Pisa, and it would be difficult to say where the architect leaves off and the sculptor begins in the transformation of this tribune, made for a prac- tical purpose, into an essentially decorative object. In other words, when the journeyman stone-carver sub- sides into the background and the sculptor — which is to say the stone-carver of individual genius — takes his place, the change is effected amid conditions which keep sculpture a craft as well as an art; and this situation endures for generations, modified in many ways as different types of personal force arise, but true, in the main , to the broad instinct at which we have just glanced. That instinct was a sound one. The man of the Renaissance knew that art embraced not only the greater but the lesser, and that it was as much worth his while, when the chance offered, to do an ordinary bit of craftsmanship as to produce some elaborate tour de force. Thus you find the pul- pits of the Pisani, their Fonte Maggiore at Perugia, 
/*** End Page =11= ***/
/*** Page =12= ***/
BENVENUTO CELLINI or Jacopo della Quercia's Fonte Gaia at Siena, suc- ceeded by triumphs of pure craftsmanship like the pulpit at Prato which Donatello and Michelozzo did together, or like any of those countless sepulchral monuments of which Desiderio's tomb for Cardinal Marsuppini, in Santa Croce, is perhaps the most con- clusive type. Verrocchio, with the power in him to do a thing like the Colleoni at Venice, approaches with the same creative ardour, the same impassioned feel- ing for beauty, not only that heroic equestrian statue, but the Medici tomb in the sacristy of San Lorenzo at Florence, a tomb of wholly formal decoration. The point of view is in each case the same. " Make the work beautiful/' he says, "no matter what its form may be/' He makes it so, and incidentally he helps to establish a tradition. The spirit of the man of genius was shared, in a measure, even by the mediocrity, and as you look over the whole mass of Renaissance work in stone, metal, or, for that matter, any mate- rial, you are struck by the way in which craftsman- ship is raised to a higher power. A certain largeness of feeling is in the air, and a lantern wrought by some Florentine to-day unknown, a setting given to a jewel at a shop whose proprietor, even in his lifetime, never had any celebrity whatever, bears the same stamp that you find on the noblest productions of the era. Why was that stamp not recaptured by Cellini ? He had the sincerity of his predecessors, and their zeal. What he lacked was that something, next to impos- sible to define, which seems more the property of an [ xiv 3

ARTIST AND WRITER age than of any one individual. It is the fashion in these scientific days to put the " document" in the foreground and leave "the spirit of things " to take care of itself, as a volatile, tricksy quality, full of danger for the unwary. " There never was an artistic period," said Mr. Whistler. "There never was an art-loving nation." That kind of a re- mark wears a convincing air. For a moment one hesi- tates to contradict. But he who hesitates in this mat- ter is unquestionably lost. You cannot put your fin- ger on some unmistakable source of inspiration in fifteenth-century Italy and say that it acted automati- cally, making masters out of all the artists coming within the range of its influence. But you can dis- cern at this time an element which presently disap- pears, a general atmosphere, dominant in Italian life, which, for the artist, serves both as a stimulus and as a check upon his professional conscience. This atmo- sphere dies down as the great body of creative artists shrinks in size, and in all things, in politics and in social life as well as in art, Italy begins to show signs of exhaustion, of decadence. Traditions sur- vive, but in a sadly debilitated condition. Cellini cher- ishes the highest ideals of goldsmithing, and it is plain from the opening pages of his treatise on that subject that he considered himself as one of the line of Ghiberti,Pollaiuolo, Donatello and Verrocchio; but he was nothing of the sort. The gods had begun to withdraw their gifts from Italy when Cellini saw the light in 1500. In truth they had lingered in lavish

BENVENUTO CELLINI mood for a long time. They had given Italy the Pisani and Jacopo della Quercia. Then had come Ghiberti , Br unelleschi , Donatello and Luca d ella Rob- bia and his kin, and, as though this were not enough, man after man was sent into the world to make Ital- ian sculpture worthy of Italian painting. Besides art- ists cast in giant mould like Donatello or Verrocchio, there were any number of sculptors so accomplished that they can scarcely be dismissed as forming, in a colourless way, the rank and file. Higher praise than that must go to Desiderio da Settigano or the Rosel- lini ; to Mino or to Pollaiuolo ; to Matteo Civitali or to Benedetto da Maiano. Nor was Tuscany alone thus bountifully endowed. Pisanello and Matteo de Pasti had been showing at Verona how the Renaissance medal might be made to rival the antique coin. Other masters might be cited from other regions. The coun- try everywhere had more or less reason to congratu- late itself on its sculptors. Then the effort seems to be too much of a strain, a kind of blight falls upon plastic art, and only one figure, that of Michael An- gelo, continues to illustrate the grand style down into the sixteenth century. It is as though fate had done all that could be done to place models of what sculpture should be before Cellini, but had grudged him the voiceless whisper, the invisible spark, the impalpable something in the air, which had thrilled the generations just preced- ing his own, and had caused masterpieces to appear before men as nature causes fruits and flowers to C xvi 3

ARTIST AND WRITER issue forth from the sun- warmed earth. In a word, Cellini's limitations, which are to be ascribed first and last to the caprice of destiny, are understood the bet- ter if we remember the character of the period into which he was born. It needed a fiercer, more mas- terful nature than his — and his was masterful and fierce enough in all conscience — to conquer the dead- ening tendency of the time. One might say that it was pathetic, too, — if pathos had not a certain incongruity where Cellini is concerned, — to observe the depth and strength of his faculty of appreciation. He knew the right thing when it was put before him, and there is nothing more ingratiating about him than the gusto with which he lauds a great artist. He alludes to Leonardo as "a veritable angel incarnate ;" and of "that divinest painter," Michael Angelo,he speaks with positively passionate warmth. The treatment of the moving soldiers in the famous cartoon of " The Bathers M moves him to this outburst: " He drew them at the very moment the alarm is sounded, and the men all naked run to arms ; so splendid is their action that nothing survives of ancient or of modern art which touches the same lofty point of excellence." When Cosimo de Medici asked him to model a Per- seus for the Loggia dei Lanzi, which was already adorned by Donatello's "Judith" and Michael An- gelo's " David," he replied after this fashion: " Most excellent, my lord, upon the piazza are now stand- ing works by the great Donatello and the incompara- ble Michael Angelo, the two greatest men who have C xvii 3

BENVENUTO CELLINI ever lived since the days of the ancients. But since your Excellence encourages my model with such praise, I feel the heart to execute it at least thrice as well in bronze." Precisely — he had the heart, but that was not enough. For his readiness to apprehend the true stature of a Michael Angelo, a Donatello or a Leonardo he is to be honoured, especially as the taste of his contemporaries, while still impressed with a sense of Michael Angelo's grandeur , steadily drifted , all through the sixteenth century, toward such types as Bandinelli, Ammanati, John of Bologna and the like, as though the stars in their courses were fight- ing to prepare the way for the seventeenth-century poseur, Bernini. But Cellini's superior judgment was not matched by his abilities, and even in his admira- tions he was not always as fortunate as he was en- lightened. There is a kind of tragic irony in the enthu- siasm that swept him to the feet of Michael Angelo, who, breathing the airs of an apocalyptic world, was just the mighty exemplar for a delicate craftsman like Cellini to avoid. That is what, as an artist, Cellini was, a delicate craftsman, with one great difference between him- self and those fifteenth-century masters with whom, as I have indicated, art and craftsmanship were often made one and the same thing. He could not give to his work, even at its finest, that exquisiteness in grain, that subtle beauty of surface, that haunting personal note, which the earlier men achieved simply because, as it seems to me, their whole natures, their C xviii ]

ARTIST AND WRITER very souls, were in harmony with the tremendous inspiration prevailing in the life about them. Pisanello can give one of his portrait medals the massive dig- nity of an antique sculpture or of a painting by Man- tegna. Verrocchio, making the Medici tomb of San Lorenzo, has some magic in his fingers which satu- rates in beauty the simple leafage of bronze with which he embellishes the porphyry sarcophagus, and that touch of his performs the same mysterious office for the network of bronze rope that fills up the rest of the opening in the design. Cellini could not have made one of those medals, he could not have made that net of twisted rope, though his life had depended on it. It was his genius, instead, to be supremely clever. Read the pages in which he tells how to do filigree work, how to set an emerald or to tint a diamond, how to make a seal or a medal, and you can almost catch the flash of the shrewd eye, you can almost hear the self-confident, dogmatic voice as it exposes to you some of the secrets of the trade. He was the Rue de la Paix in excelsis, an inspired shop-keeper, not an inspired artist. He could do any- thing he liked — with his hands. It was when quali- ties less ponderable were needed that he was at a disadvantage. Intellect, spirituality, fine feeling, these are the resources that he lacked as an artist. When he produces the famous salt-cellar for Francis I., now at Vienna, he makes the first stage of the work an affair of reasonablyjust proportions, but then he mo- dels the figures in the round on too large a scale, and L xix 3

BENVENUTO CELLINI in style as well as in bulk detaches them from the spirit of the design considered as a goldsmith's de- sign. He is both goldsmith and sculptor in this re- nowned piece, but awkwardly, and to the advantage of neither the one nor the other. A master of the early Renaissance would have known how to exploit both professions, on an occasion like this, in perfect harmony. Cellini is without the necessary poise. Let him do pure jeweller's work, let him design a cas- ket or a chalice, and he is tolerably sure of himself. Give him a commission permitting him a wider scope, and, in his impetuous way, he flings himself upon the task, works like a demon, and never realizes, as he gazes upon the finished object, that he has just missed striking twelve. Possibly his ill luck is thrown into sharper relief for us through the very fact that his more ambitious productions form such a small group — there is little chance for flaws to be overlooked. The Perseus is, of course, the salient member of that group, but be- fore alluding to it I must refer to the work which has always seemed to me, more than any other, to reflect upon Cellini the kind of credit which doubt- less he most craved, the kind that goes to the sculp- tor in the strict sense. This is the bust of Bindo Al- toviti. It is a work of simple dignity, conceived in a virile mood, and executed without that teasing of the surfaces which is elsewhere so apt to be character- istic of Cellini. Michael Angelo thought well of it, writing to Cellini a note which the latter quotes with [XX ]

INTRODUCTION "Pur fra color , che son di vita privi s Vivo vorrei Benvenuto Cellini , Che senza alcun ritegno o barbezzale Delle cose malfatte dicea male, E la cupola al mondo singolare Non si potea di lodar mai saziare; E la so lea chiamare, Alzandola alle stelle y La maraviglia delle cose belle; Certo non capirebbe or nella pelle, In tal guisa dipintala veggendo; E saltando e correndo e fulminando y <S" andrebbe querelando, E per tutto gridando ad alia voce, Giorgin a" Arezzo metterebbe in croce" I VI In spite of his vehemence and passion, Cellini had not depth or tenacity of feeling. His amours were nu- merous, but volatile and indiscriminate. As a friend he seems to have been somewhat uncertain ; not treach- erous, but wayward. Hospitable indeed and gener- ous he proved himself by his conduct toward Ital- ians in Paris, and by his thoroughgoing kindness for the Sputasenni family in Florence. Still, if any- thing, either in love or comradeship, crossed his hu- mour, he sacrificed emotion to vanity. Like many egotistical people, he extended the affection he felt 1 " Fain would I recall to life Benvenuto Cellini, who without reserve or restraint spoke evil of things ill done $ he used to exalt our cupola with indefatigable praise as something unique in the world; he called it the miracle of beauteous master- pieces. Assuredly that man would jump out of his skin with rage to see it thus be- daubed; leaping and running and fulminating, he would go about the city uttering his indignation at the top of his voice, and 'would crucify this little George of Arezzo."

XXX The plague had by this time almost died out, so that the survivors, when they met together alive, rejoiced with much delight in one another's company. This led to the formation of a club of painters, sculptors, and goldsmiths, the best that were in Rome ; and the founder of it was a sculptor with the name of Michel Agnolo. 1 He was a Sienese and a man of great ability, who could hold his own against any other workman in that art; but, above all, he was the most amusing comrade and the heartiest good fellow in the uni- verse. Of all the members of the club, he was the eldest, and yet the youngest from the strength and vigour of his body. We often came together; at the very least twice a week. I must not omit to mention that our society counted Giulio Romano, the painter, and Gian Francesco, both of them celebrated pupils of the mighty Raffaello da Urbino. After many and many merry meetings, it seemed good to our worthy president that for the follow- ing Sunday we should repair to supper in his house, and that each one of us should be obliged to bring with him his crow ( such was the nickname Michel Agnolo gave to women in the club ) , and that whoso did not bring one should be sconced by paying a supper to the whole company.

I had reckoned upon being well provided with a young woman of consid- erable beauty, called Pantasilea, who was very much in love with me ; but I was obliged to give her up to one of my dearest friends, called II Bachiacca, who on his side had been, and still was, over head and ears in love with her.' This exchange excited a cer- tain amount of lover's anger, because the lady, see- ing I had abandoned her at Bachiacca's first entreaty, imagined that I held in slight esteem the great affec- tion which she bore me. In course of time a very serious incident grew out of this misunderstanding, through her desire to take revenge for the affront I had put upon her ; whereof I shall speak hereafter in the proper place. Well, then, the hour was drawing nigh when we had to present ourselves before that company of men of genius, each with his own crow ; and I was still un- provided; and yet I thought it would be stupid to fail of such a madcap bagatelle ; 2 but what particularly weighed upon my mind was that I did not choose to lend the light of my countenance in that illustrious sphere to some miserable plume-plucked scarecrow. All these considerations made me devise a pleasant 1 'There <were tivo artists at this epoch sur named Bachiacca, the twin sons ofUber- tino Verdi, called respetli<vely Francesco and Antonio.

Having taken this resolve, I sent for a stripling of sixteen years, who lived in the next house to mine; he was the son of a Spanish coppersmith. This young man gave his time to Latin studies, and was very diligent in their pursuit. He bore the name of Diego, had a handsome figure, and a complexion of mar- vellous brilliancy ; the outlines of his head and face were far more beautiful than those of the antique Antinous: I had often copied them, gaining thereby much honour from the works in which I used them. The youth had no acquaintances, and was therefore quite unknown ; dressed very ill and negligently ; all his affections being set upon those wonderful stud- ies of his. After bringing him to my house, I begged him to let me array him in the woman's clothes which I had caused to be laid out. He readily complied, and put them on at once, while I added new beauties to the beauty of his face by the elaborate and studied way in which I dressed his hair. In his ears I placed two little rings, set with two large and fair pearls ; the rings were broken ; they only clipped his ears, which looked as though they had been pierced. After- wards I wreathed his throat with cjiains of gold and rich jewels, and ornamented his fair hands with rings. Then I took him in a pleasant manner by one ear, and drew him before a great looking-glass. The lad, when he beheld himself, cried out with a burst of enthusiasm : " Heavens ! is that Diego ?

When we had fired two rounds apiece, I crept cautiously up to the wall, and observ- ing among the enemy a most extraordinary confu- sion, I discovered afterwards that one of our shots had killed the Constable of Bourbon ; and from what I subsequently learned, he was the man whom I had first noticed above the heads of the rest. 1 Quitting our position on the ramparts, we crossed the Campo Santo, and entered the city by St. Pe- ter's ; then coming out exactly at the church of Santo Agnolo, we got with the greatest difficulty to the great gate of the castle; for the generals Renzo di Ceri and Orazio Baglioni were wounding and slaugh- tering everybody who abandoned the defence of the walls. 2 By the time we had reached the great gate, part of the foemen had already entered Rome, and we had them in our rear. The castellan had ordered the portcullis to be lowered, in order to do which they cleared a little space, and this enabled us four to get inside. On the instant that I entered, the cap- tain Pallone de' Medici claimed me as being of the Papal household, and forced me to abandon Ales- sandro, which I had to do, much against my will. I 1 All historians of the sack of Rome agree in saying that Bourbon was shot dead while placing ladders against the outworks near the shop Cellini mentions.

LIFE OF BENVENUTO CELLINI ascended to the keep, and at the same instant Pope Clement came in through the corridors into the castle ; he had refused to leave the palace of St. Pe- ter earlier, being unable to believe that his enemies would efFe6l their entrance into Rome. 1 Having got into the castle in this way, I attached myself to cer- tain pieces of artillery, which were under the com- mand of a bombardier called Giuliano Fiorentino. Leaning there against the battlements, the unhappy man could see his poor house being sacked, and his wife and children outraged ; fearing to strike his own folk, he dared not discharge the cannon, and fling- ing the burning fuse, upon the ground, he wept as though his heart would break, and tore his cheeks with both his hands. 2 Some of the other bombardiers were behaving in like manner; seeing which, I took one of the matches, and got the assistance of a few men who were not overcome by their emotions. I aimed some swivels and falconets at points where I saw it would be useful, and killed with them a good number of the enemy. Had it not been for this, the troops who poured into Rome that morning, and were marching straight upon the castle, might pos- sibly have entered it with ease, because the artillery was doing them no damage. I went on firing under * Giovio, in his Life of the Cardinal Prospero Colonna, relates how he accom- panied Clement in his flight from the Vatican to the castle. While passing some open portions of the gallery, he threw, his •violet mantle and cap of a Monsignore over the white stole of the Pontiff, for fear he might be shot at by the soldiers in the streets below. 2 The short autobiography of Raffaello da Montelupo, a man in many respecls re- sembling Cellini, confirms this part of our author s narrative . It is one of the most interesting pieces of evidence regarding what went on inside the castle during the sack of Rome. Montelupo was also a gunner, and commanded two pieces. I .68 J

LIFE OF BENVENUTO CELLINI was thejr wont, and everywhere we had but one topic of conversation. It happened one day, about noon, that a crowd of tall men and lusty young fellows, the first in the city, were assembled in my workshop, when a letter from Rome was put into my hands. It came from a man called Maestro Giacopino della Barca. His real name was Giacopo della Sciorina, but they called him della Barca in Rome, because he kept a ferry boat upon the Tiber between Ponte Sisto and Ponte Santo Agnolo. He was a person of considerable tal- ent, distinguished by his pleasantries and striking conversation, and he had formerly been a designer of patterns for the cloth-weavers in Florence. This man was intimate with the Pope, who took great pleasure in hearing him talk. Being one day engaged in conversation, they touched upon the sack and the defence of the castle. This brought me to the Pope's mind, and he spoke of me in the very highest terms, adding that if he knew where I was, he should be glad to get me back. Maestro Giacopo said I was in Florence ; whereupon the Pope bade the man write and tell me to return to him. The letter I have men- tioned was to the effect that I should do well if I re- sumed the service of Clement, and that this was sure to turn out to my advantage. The young men who were present were curious to know what the letter contained ; wherefore I con- cealed it as well as I could. Afterwards I wrote to Maestro Giacopo, begging him by no means, whether for good or evil, to write to me again. He however grew more obstinate in his officiousness, and wrote C !9 2 3

LIFE OF BENVENUTO CELLINI me another letter, so extravagantly worded, that if it had been seen, I should have got into serious trou- ble. The substance of it was that the Pope required me to come at once, wanting to employ me on work of the greatest consequence ; also that if I wished to a<5t aright, I ought to throw up everything, and not to stand against a Pope in the party of those hare- brained Radicals. This letter, when I read it, put me in such a fright, that I went to seek my dear friend Piero Landi. Direclly he set eyes on me, he asked what accident had happened to upset me so. I told my friend that it was quite impossible for me to ex- plain what lay upon my mind, and what was caus- ing me this trouble ; only I entreated him to take the keys I gave him, and to return the gems and gold in my drawers to such and such persons, whose names he would find inscribed upon my memoran- dum-book ; next, I begged him to pack up the fur- niture of my house, and keep account of it with his usual loving-kindness; and in a few days he should hear where I was. The prudent young man, guess- ing perhaps pretty nearly how the matter stood, re- plied: "My brother, go your ways quickly; then write to me, and have no further care about your things." I did as he advised. He was the most loyal friend, the wisest, the most worthy, the most dis- creet, the most affectionate that I have ever known. I left Florence and went to Rome, and from there I wrote to him. 1 1 Cellini has been severely taxed for leaving Florence at this juntlure and taking service under Pope Clement, the oppressor of her liberties. His own narrative ad- mits some sense of shame. Yet voe should remember that he never took any decided [ 193 ]

LIFE OF BENVENUTO CELLINI xliii Upon my arrival in Rome, I found several of my former friends, by whom I was very well received and kindly entertained. No time was lost before I set myself to work at things which brought me pro- fit, but were not notable enough to be described. There was a fine old man, a goldsmith, called Raf- faello del Moro, who had considerable reputation in the trade, and was to boot a very worthy fellow. He begged me to consent to enter his workshop, say- ing he had some commissions of importance to ex- ecute, on which high profits might be looked for; so I accepted his proposal with good- will. More than ten days had elapsed, and I had not pre- sented myself to Maestro Giacopino della Barca. Meeting me one day by accident, he gave me a hearty welcome, and asked me how long I had been in Rome. When I told him I had been there about a fortnight, he took it very ill, and said that I showed little esteem for a Pope who had urgently compelled him to write three times for me. I, who had taken his persistence in the matter still more ill, made no reply, but swallowed down my irritation. The man, who suffered from a flux of words, began one of his long yarns, and went on talking, till at the last, when I saw him tired out, I merely said that he might bring me to the Pope when he saw fit. He answered that part in politics, and belonged to a family of Medicean sympathies. His father served Lorenzo and Piero ; his brother was a soldier of Giovanni delle Bande Nere and Duke Alessandro. Many most excellent Florentines were convinced that the Me- dicean government ivas beneficial; and an artist had certainly more to expecl from it than from the Republic. I 194 ]

LIFE OF BENVENUTO CELLINI he prayed me to stand firm by him, because the legions were a thousandfold more than he had sum- moned, and were the most dangerous of all the denizens of hell ; and now that they had settled what I asked, it behoved us to be civil to them and dis- miss them gently. On the other side, the boy, who was beneath the pentacle, shrieked out in terror that a million of the fiercest men were swarming round and threatening us. He said, moreover, that four huge giants had appeared, who were striving to force their way inside the circle. Meanwhile the necro- mancer, trembling with fear, kept doing his best with mild and soft persuasions to dismiss them. Vin- cenzio Romoli,who quaked like an aspen leaf, looked after the perfumes. Though I was quite as frightened as the rest of them, I tried to show it less, and in- spired them all with marvellous courage; but the truth is that I had given myself up for dead when I saw the terror of the necromancer. The boy had stuck his head between his knees, exclaiming: "This is how I will meet death, for we are certainly dead men." Again I said to him: "These creatures are all inferior to us, and what you see is only smoke and shadow ; so then raise your eyes." When he had raised them he cried out: "The whole Coliseum is in flames, and the fire is advancing on us;" then covering his face with his hands, he groaned again that he was dead, and that he could not endure the sight longer. The necromancer appealed for my support, entreating me to stand firm by him, and to have assafetida flung upon the coals ; so I turned to Vincenzio Romoli, and told him to make the fumi- C 2 54 ]

While uttering these words I looked at Agnolino Gaddi, whose eyes were starting from their sockets in his terror, and who was more than half dead, and said to him: "Agnolo, in time and place like this we must not yield to fright, but do the utmost to bestir ourselves; therefore, up at once, and fling a handful of that assafetida upon the fire/' Agnolo, at the moment when he moved to do this, let fly such a volley from his breech, that it was far more effectual than the assafetida. 1 The boy, roused by that great stench and noise, lifted his face a little, and hearing me laugh, he plucked up courage, and said the devils were taking to flight tempestuously. So we abode thus until the matin-bells began to sound. Then the boy told us again that but few remained, and those were at a distance. When the necro- mancer had concluded his ceremonies, he put off his wizard's robe, and packed up a great bundle of books which he had brought with him; then, all together, we issued with him from the circle, huddling as close as we could to one another, especially the boy, who had got into the middle, and taken the necromancer by his gown and me by the cloak. All the while that we were going toward our houses in the Banchi, he kept saying that two of the devils he had seen in the Coliseum were gambolling in front of us, skipping now along the roofs and now upon the ground. The necromancer assured me that, often as he had en- tered magic circles, he had never met with such a serious affair as this. He also tried to persuade me to assist him in consecrating a book, by means of 1 Fece una istrombazzata di coregge con tanta abundanzia di merda.

He entered Rome with extraordinary pomp, the description of which I leave to others, since I mean to treat of those things only which concern myself. 1 Immediately after his arrival, he gave the Pope a diamond which he had bought for twelve thousand crowns. This diamond the Pope committed to my care, ordering me to make a ring to the mea- sure of his Holiness's finger ; but first he wished me to bring the book in the state to which I had advanced it. I took it accordingly, and he was highly pleased with it; then he asked my advice concerning the apology which could be reasonably made to the Em- peror for the unfinished condition of my work. I said that my indisposition would furnish a sound excuse, since his Majesty, seeing how thin and pale I was, would very readily believe and accept it. To this the Pope replied that he approved of the suggestion, but that I should add on the part of his Holiness, when I presented the book to the Emperor, that I made him the present of myself. Then he told me in detail how I had to behave, and the words I had to say. These words I repeated to the Pope, asking him if he wished me to deliver them in that way. He re- plied : " You would acquit yourself to admiration if you had the courage to address the Emperor as you are addressing me." Then I said that I had the cour- age to speak with far greater ease and freedom to the Emperor, seeing that the Emperor was clothed as I was, and that I should seem to be speaking to a man formed like myself; this was not the case when I addressed his Holiness,in whom I beheld a far supe- 1 The entry into Rome took place April 6, 1536.

To these words the Pope responded : " Go, my Benvenuto ; you are a man of ability; do us honour, and it will be well for you/' xci The Pope ordered out two Turkish horses, which had belonged to Pope Clement, and were the most beautiful that ever came to Christendom. Messer Durante, 1 his chamberlain, was bidden to bring them through the lower galleries of the palace, and there to give them to the Emperor, repeating certain words which his Holiness dictated to him. We both went down together, and when we reached the presence of the Emperor, the horses made their entrance through those halls with so much spirit and such a noble carriage that the Emperor and every one were struck with wonder. Thereupon Messer Durante advanced in so graceless a manner, and delivered his speech with so much of Brescian lingo, mumbling his words over in his mouth, that one never saw or heard anything worse; indeed the Emperor could not refrain from smiling at him. I meanwhile had already uncovered my piece ; and observing that the Emperor had turned his eyes towards me with a very gracious look, I advanced at once and said: " Sacred Majesty, our most holy Father, Pope Paolo, 1 Messer Durante Duranti, Prefecl of the Camera under Paul III., <who ga<ve him the hat in 1 544, and the Bishopric of Brescia aftemuards. £ 329 H

LIFE OF BENVENUTO CELLINI sends this book of the Virgin as a present to your Majesty, the which is written in a fair clerk's hand, and illuminated by the greatest master who ever pro- fessed that art ; and this rich cover of gold and jewels is unfinished, as you here behold it, by reason of my illness: wherefore his Holiness, together with the book, presents me also, and attaches me to your Majesty in order that I may complete the work; nor this alone, but everything which you may have it in your mind to execute so long as life is left me, will I perform at your service." Thereto the Emperor responded: "The book is acceptable to me, and so are you; but I desire you to complete it for me in Rome; when it is finished, and you are restored to health, bring it me and come to see me." Afterwards, in course of conversation, he called me by my name, which made me wonder, because no words had been dropped in which my name occurred; and he said that he had seen that fastening of Pope Clement's cope, on which I had wrought so many wonderful figures. We continued talking in this way a whole half hour, touching on divers topics artistic and agreeable ; then, since it seemed to me that I had ac- quitted myself with more honour than I had ex- pected, I took the occasion of a slight lull in the con- versation to make my bow and to retire. The Em- peror was heard to say : " Let five hundred golden crowns be given at once to Benvenuto." The person who brought them up asked who the Pope's man was who had spoken to the Emperor.
