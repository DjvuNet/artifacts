As whole-genome sequencing for cancer genome analysis becomes a clinical tool, a full understanding of 
the variables affecting sequencing analysis output is required. Here using tumour-normal sample pairs 
from two different types of cancer, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and medulloblastoma, we conduct a 
benchmarking exercise within the context of the International Cancer Genome Consortium. We compare 
sequencing methods, analysis pipelines and validation methods. We show that using PCR-free methods 
and increasing sequencing depth to B100 shows beneﬁts, as long as the tumour:control coverage 
ratio remains balanced. We observe widely varying mutation call rates and low concordance among 
analysis pipelines, reﬂecting the artefact-prone nature of the raw data and lack of standards for dealing 
with the artefacts. However, we show that, using the benchmark mutation set we have created, many 
issues are in fact easy to remedy and have an immediate positive impact on mutation detection accuracy.

The International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) is 
characterizing over 25,000 cancer cases from many forms 
of cancer1. Currently, there are 74 projects supported 
by different national and international funding agencies. As 
innovation and development of sequencing technologies have 
driven prices down and throughput up, projects have been 
transitioning from exome to whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 
tumour and matched germline samples, supplemented by 
transcript and methylation analyses when possible, facilitating 
the discovery of new biology for many different forms of 
cancer2–10. However, as data from the different projects began to 
be collected and centralized (https://dcc.icgc.org/), it became 
apparent that there are marked differences in how teams generate 
WGS data and analyse it. On the basis of cost, capacity 
and analytical experience, it was initially determined that 
comprehensive identiﬁcation of tumour-speciﬁc somatic 
mutations requires WGS with a minimum of 30 sequence 
coverage of each the tumour and normal genomes11 with paired 
reads on the order of 100–250 bp in length, depending on the 
platform. However, from project to project the sample 
preparation, coverage of tumour and normal samples and read 
lengths vary. Even more variability exists in the approaches to 
identify differences between tumour and normal genomes, 
evidenced by the many strategies developed to identify somatic 
single-base mutations (SSM)12, somatic insertion/deletion 
mutations (SIM) and larger structural changes (rearrangements 
and chromosome segment copy number changes)5. 
This variation makes comparison of mutation calls across 
cancers challenging because of the unknown contributions of 
individual pipeline components and parameters on the accuracy 
of the calls. Benchmark data sets and analytical tools13–17 have 
been developed for variant calling on normal genomes, while 
those for cancer have largely focused on SSM detection from 
exome sequencing12,18. Benchmarking of mutation calling from 
exome data from The Cancer Genome Atlas has raised concerns 
about biased inferences and highlights the need for benchmark 
data sets19. In our study we set out to investigate the factors that 
need to be considered to generate high-quality whole-genome 
sequence data and high-conﬁdence variant calls from tumour- 
normal pairs, including new sources of bias and pitfalls not 
encountered in exome data. 
We explored several benchmarking strategies. First, we 
evaluated somatic mutation calling pipelines using a common 
set of 40 WGS reads of average quality corresponding to a case 
of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). In a second benchmark, 
we evaluated both sequencing methods and somatic mutation 
calling pipelines using matched samples from a case of 
medulloblastoma (MB, a malignant pediatric brain tumour 
arising in the cerebellum20,21) from the ICGC PedBrain Tumor 
project. Both cancers exhibit a high degree of tumour purity 
(95–98%). For each case, we made available unaligned sequence 
reads of a tumour (B40 genome coverage) and its 
corresponding normal genome (B30 coverage) to members 
of the ICGC consortium, who then returned somatic mutation 
calls. In contrast to the approach taken in a recent benchmark of 
SSM calling using three simulated tumour genomes22, we have 
used the sequence from a real tumour-normal pair and made a 
concerted effort to manually curate both SSMs and SIMs 
detectable at a sequencing depth 8–10 times in excess of the 
standard amount (B300 ). We argue that real, not simulated, 
mutations are more useful for dissecting performance of mutation 
callers with respect to real genome-wide mutational signatures, 
and methods for detecting insertion–deletion mutations, an even 
bigger challenge to somatic mutation callers, must also be 
benchmarked. Our study has two main results: one, we identify 
outstanding issues in somatic mutation analysis from WGS data 
and begin to formulate a set of best practices to be adopted more 
widely by genome researchers, and, two, we provide two 
benchmark data sets for testing or developing new somatic 
mutation calling pipelines. 
Results 
WGS data generation. We conducted a ﬁrst benchmark exercise 
using WGS data generated from a CLL tumour-normal pair and 
then a second using a case of MB. Both tumour types were 
expected to have relatively low mutational load and not very 
pervasive structural changes: CLL has a few known translocations 
and large copy number variants, and MB exhibits a large 
degree of tetraploidy but is otherwise typically free of complex 
rearrangements. The quality of the CLL data was below today s 
standards but typical for the time it was produced, while the 
quality of the MB library preparation and produced sequence 
were of high quality. The validation strategies also differed. For 
CLL we chose to validate submitted mutations by target capture 
and sequencing with two independent platforms (MiSeq and 
IonTorrent). This approach was limited by technical issues 
inherent to target capture and sequencing on these other 
platforms, which led to a low rate of independently validated 
mutations. Moreover, the real false-negative (FN) rates were 
underestimated because of the limited coverage provided to 
participants. For the MB data set, B300 in sequence reads 
were generated by ﬁve different sequencing centres, which we 
joined and used to create a curated set of mutations. The MB 
tumour presented with a tetraploid background combined with 
other changes of ploidy in chromosomes 1, 4, 8, 15 and 17 
(Supplementary Fig. 1), giving us the opportunity to benchmark 
performance at lower mutant allele frequencies. Moreover, the 
high depth and relatively unbiased coverage of the genome 
enabled higher sensitivity in mutation detection leading to a more 
inclusive set of curated mutations. For these reasons, we present 
here only the results for the MB benchmark. 
Evaluation of sequencing library construction methods. Several 
different protocols were used for generating sequencing libraries 
at the ﬁve contributing sequencing centres, which varied in their 
reagent supplier, methods for selecting the fragment size of 
library inserts and use of amplifying PCR steps (Table 1 and 
Supplementary Table 1). Interestingly, these differences resulted 
in marked variation in the evenness of coverage genome-wide as 
well as in key regions of interest such as exons. PCR-free libraries 
were found to give the most even coverage, with very little effect 
of GC content on coverage levels (Fig. 1a). Evenness is directly 
correlated with coverage of the genome: when we downsampled 
each data set to an average 30 tumour and control coverage 
(libraries sequenced to less than 28 , L.G and L.H, were 
excluded from further analysis), we see that in the best- 
performing libraries (L.A and L.B controls), 73–74% of the 
genome was covered at or above 25 , while the worst- 
performing library (L.F tumour) had only 46% of the genome 
covered at this level (Fig. 1b). In general, the coverage distribution 
was more even and the percentage of well-covered regions was 
higher in the control libraries compared with the tumour 
libraries, reﬂecting the different copy number states of the 
tumour. An unusual pattern of GC content distribution in control 
library E, however, meant that this was slightly worse than its 
tumour counterpart. The percentage of exonic regions covered at 
r10 (that is, likely insufﬁcient to accurately call mutations) 
also varied, with a range from less than 1% missing in the best- 
performing libraries to more than 10% in the worst (Fig. 1c), 
demonstrating that sequencing library preparation performance 
can have a signiﬁcant impact on the ability to identify coding

variants in downstream analyses. Performance in other regions of 
interest, such as enhancers and untranslated repeats, was similarly 
variable (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 2). 
Evaluation of sequencing depth. Combining the sequencing data 
generated from each participating centre gave us the opportunity 
to investigate a tumour-normal pair with very deep coverage. 
After merging each of the individual pairs, the combined tumour 
coverage was 314 , and the control 272 . To remove already 
identiﬁed artefacts (Supplementary Note 1), we excluded the 
tumour library from centre E and the slightly contaminated 
control library from centre B. For comparison of mutation-calling 
metrics at a range of coverage levels, the combined tumour and 
normal sets were randomly serially downsampled to 250, 200, 
150, 100, 50, 30 and 20 coverage and then analysed using 
the standard DKFZ pipeline (MB.I, Supplementary Methods). 
The total number of mutations increases when going from 30 
to 50 and further to 100 coverage; however, no striking 
increase is seen above this level (at 100 , 95% of the maximum 
mutation number are detected, in contrast to only 77% at 30 ; 
Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 2). While the majority of 
mutations were called at the 30 level, there were some notable 
differences in the number and type of mutations detected as the 
coverage increased. The sensitivity for detecting mutations 
with lower mutant allele frequencies (that is, subclonal alterations 
and/or events happening after polysomic changes but also major 
somatic mutations in samples with low tumour cell content) was 
much greater with higher coverage, as seen from density plots 
of mutations versus allele frequency (AF, Fig. 2b). This effect 
was even more striking when considering mutation calls per 
chromosome, which clearly shows the difference between low 
and high coverage when looking for late-occurring mutations 
after whole-chromosome copy number changes (Supplementary 
Fig. 3). 
Effect of tumour purity on mutation calling. Since MBs tend to 
show a very high tumour cell content (usually above 95%, and for 
this sample B98%, because of their nature as masses of small, 
round, tightly packed tumour cells), the high coverage data 
set also provided an opportunity to model the dynamics of 
mutation calling with increasing coverage and with increasing 
proportions of contaminating normal tissue. We found that the 
mutation calls with increasing coverage were accurately modelled 
with a Michaelis–Menten equation, reaching saturation (no or 
minimal additional mutations called as coverage increases) at 
around 100 (Fig. 2c). The impact of normal cells on SSM 
detection could be thought of as a mixed-type inhibition of 
mutation detection sensitivity, which we examined by mixing 
increasing proportions of normal sequence reads (17, 33 and 
50%) into the tumour data set and re-calling mutations. Each 
curve displayed the same plateau after B100 as the pure 
tumour sample; however, the addition of any normal content 
meant that the maximum mutation count from the pure tumour 
could not be reached, even at 250 total coverage. At 100 , the 
detected proportions of mutation calls from the pure sample 
were 95%, 90% and 85%, respectively, for 17%, 33% and 50% 
contamination (Fig. 2c). At lower coverage, the normal cell 
content had a proportionally larger impact. At 30 , only 92%, 
83% or 68% of the calls from the 30 pure sample were called 
when adding 17%, 33% or 50% normal reads, respectively 
(Supplementary Table 2). For SIMs called using the DKFZ 
pipeline, a different picture was observed. SIM calling at present 
likely suffers at least as much from low speciﬁcity as from low 
sensitivity, as indicated by the fact that increasing coverage 
actually reduces the number of called variants (that is, the FP rate 
decreases; Supplementary Fig. 4). 
Effect of tumour to normal sequencing depth ratio.W 
e 
investigated the effect of tumour-normal coverage ratios on 
variant calling to assess whether increasing coverage of the 
tumour alone is sufﬁcient to increase mutation detection 
sensitivity. The 250 tumour genome was therefore compared 
with control genomes at 200, 150, 100, 50 and 30 coverages. 
Down to the 150 level, few differences are seen in the 
mutations called when compared with the 250 /250 standard 
(Supplementary Fig. 5a,b). At lower control coverage levels, a 
notable increase is observed in the overall number of mutations 
reported because of a sharp rise in those called with a low allele 
fraction. Since these mutations are not called in the 250 versus 
250 set, it is almost certain that they are sequencing artefacts 
arising in a very small proportion of calls, which appear to be 
somatic when the control coverage is insufﬁcient to show the 
same phenomenon. These new calls are dominated by a T4G 
base change arising in a particular sequence context (GpTpG, 
Supplementary Fig. 5c). Indeed, performing a motif analysis on 
the wider context of these changes revealed that the majority 
occur at a thymine base within a homopolymer run of guanines 
(Supplementary Fig. 5d). Keeping the ratio of tumour:normal 
coverage closer to one therefore appears to play a role in main- 
taining the accuracy of mutation calling with standard pipelines, 
since any systematic artefacts are then balanced out in both the 
tumour and control data sets. While it may be possible to

apply additional ﬁlters to account for the new false positives (FPs) 
seen in unbalanced comparisons, this would potentially come at 
the cost of a reduced sensitivity for detecting true mutations 
with low allele frequencies (that is, tumour subpopulations), 
which are of particular interest when increasing sequencing 
coverage depth. 
Curation of a Gold Set of somatic mutations. We used the high- 
coverage (314 :272 ) data set from the sequencing benchmark 
to curate a Gold Set of veriﬁed somatic mutations (Methods). 
Gold Set mutations were classiﬁed (Table 2) according to the 
potential issues that may lead to an incorrect call: Tier 1 muta- 
tions have a mutant AFZ10%, Tier 2 mutations have AFZ5%, 
Tier 3 includes all veriﬁed mutations supported by unambiguous 
alignments, while Tier 4 includes additional mutations with more 
complicated or ambiguous local alignments and Tier 5 includes 
those with unusually high or low read depth. 
The MB Gold Set had a total of 1,620 bona ﬁde mutation calls 
across all tiers (Table 2), with 962, 1,101, 1,255 and 1,263 SSMs in 
Tiers 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively, and 337 and 347 SIMs in Tiers 1 
and 4, respectively. The mutational load of this tumour was B0.5 
mutations per Mbp. Of these, there were eleven exonic SSMs 
(seven missense, three synonymous and one early stop) and one 
splice site mutation. We found that 32% of SSMs are in 
RepeatMasked sequence, 9% in tandem repeats (4% in homo- 
polymer tracts) and 4.4% adjacent to tandem repeats. About a 
quarter of SSMs (27%) exhibits a mutant AF in the tumour of less 
than 10%, with 6% being very close to the alternate AF in the 
normal sample (Supplementary Table 3). For curated SIMs, 83% 
fall in tandem repeats (71% in homopolymers; Supplementary 
Table 4). 
Evaluation of somatic mutation calling pipelines. A submission 
and revision process was set up for the MB benchmark with 
guidelines for the mutation call format. Participating centres 
were provided with the best-quality sequence data set from 
the sequencing benchmark (L.A). Using these FASTQs, they 
produced SSM and SIM calls and submitted them for evaluation. 
We received 18 SSM and 16 SIM submissions. 
Submissions were compared among themselves and to the 
Gold Set. Figure 3 shows the overlap of mutation call sets (private 
calls are shown in Supplementary Figs 6 and 7). We found that 
only 205 SSMs and one SIM were agreed upon by all submitters 
(Fig. 3 and Supplementary Figs 6 and 7). Agreement among SSM 
sets was much greater than agreement among SIMs in general. 
In Fig. 4 we show the precision versus recall of the submitted 
mutation calls. Each letter corresponds to a submission compared 
with the Gold Set of Tiers 1, 2 or 3, with comparison with Tier 1 
(AF410% mutant AF) having the highest value for recall in the 
plot, Tier 2 (AF45%) the second highest and Tier 3 (AF4B2%) 
the lowest. Precision is always calculated against Tier 4, which 
also includes mutations that are complex or have ambiguous 
positions. 
We observed a cluster of well-performing SSM submissions 
with high values for both precision and recall. Those with the 
highest F1 scores (Table 3) were MB.Q and MB.J, pipelines that 
combine two different somatic mutation callers: qSNP23 with 
GATK24 and SGA25 with FreeBayes26 (Supplementary Methods).

Figure 1 | Differences between the different sample libraries. Libraries A, E and G are PCR-free. (a) GC bias of the different libraries. The genome was 
segmented into 10-kb windows. For each window, the GC content was calculated and the coverage for the respective library was added. For better 
comparability, the coverage was normalized by dividing by the mean. The major band in normal corresponds to autosomes, while the lower band 
corresponds to sex chromosomes. The increased number of bands in the tumour is because of a higher number of ploidy states in the (largely) tetraploid 
tumour sample. (b) Cumulative coverage displayed for different libraries. Displayed are all libraries sequenced to at least 28 . To make the values 
comparable, we downsampled all samples to a coverage of 28 (the lowest coverage of the initially sequenced libraries). The plot shows the percentage of 
the genome (y axis) covered with a given minimum coverage (x axis). (c) Percentage of certain regions of interest covered with less than 10 . Different 
colours are used to distinguish centres.

achieve higher recall; about two-thirds of all mutations (or 480% 
of Tier 1 mutations) can be detected without making many false- 
positive (FP) calls, after which increases in recall are accompanied 
by precipitous declines in precision. This is because of the fact 
that at 40 depth, a fraction of the curated mutations is 
impossible to detect. Likewise, the one submission whose 
precision was the highest (MB.L1) was not much more precise 
than MB.B or MB.Q, which both found over twice as many true 
mutations (Table 3). For SIMs (Fig. 4b), some submissions 
achieved precisions greater than 0.9; however, their sensitivities 
were still low. The highest F1 score (0.65 for MB.I) is noticeably 
lower than that obtained for SSMs (0.79). Overall, SIM detection 
appears to be more challenging, with performance lagging behind 
than that of SSM detection. 
Correlation of pipeline components with shared mutations. 
Could those submissions that cluster together in terms of 
precision and recall be calling the same mutations or have 
similarities in terms of their pipelines? Using a measure of pair- 
wise overlap, the Jaccard index, we clustered the submissions and 
display the results as both a heatmap and hierarchical clustering 
in Supplementary Fig. 8. Correspondence analysis gave similar 
results. We also broke them down by true positives (TPs) or FPs 
(Supplementary Figs 9–12) and clustered the pipelines based on 
shared components or parameters (Supplementary Fig. 13, input 
data in Supplementary Data 1). We ﬁnd that when submissions 
agree, they tend to agree on true mutations, and when they 
disagree, these are more likely to be FPs or true negatives. Some 
notable exceptions can be observed among the FP SIMs, where 
MB.L1 and MB.L2 cluster as do MB.F and MB.N. These con- 
cordant FPs may indicate incompleteness of the Gold Set and/or 
similarities in the pipelines. In this case, MB.L1 is a ﬁltered subset 
of MB.L2, explaining the high degree of overlap. MB.F and MB.N 
both use Strelka27 to call SIMs, possibly explaining the overlap in 
FPs. Indeed, some overlap of MB.F and MB.N FP SIMs is seen 
with MB.L2, which also uses Strelka. For TP SIMs, pipelines that 
share components tend to have higher overlap, for example, 
among Strelka calls or among GATK SomaticIndelDetector calls. 
Sometimes, we observe higher Jaccard index values for pipelines 
using different software, for example Platypus28 and Atlas- 
indel29, which are two of the most sensitive mutation callers. 
There is much more concordance among SSM calls; therefore, 
trends are harder to see among the FPs. Logically, SSM 
submissions with the highest F1 scores have the highest Jaccard 
indices. 
Genomic or alignment features affecting accuracy. We asked 
what genomic features or sample, sequence or alignment features 
might correlate with better or worse performance. We used 
rainfall plots that show density of features along a genome. 
By plotting the distance from the previous mutation (Fig. 5 and 
Supplementary Fig. 14), we can observe clustering or hotspots. 
SSM and SIM calls are coloured according to TP, FP and FN 
status. The Gold Set exhibits no mutational hotspots; therefore, 
any deviation is likely to be caused by a feature of the pipeline. 
Indeed, we detect quite different patterns: MB.Q (Fig. 5a) and

MB.B (Fig. 5b) do not display any notable hotspots, while MB.C 
(Fig. 5c), for example, has many FP mutation calls in centromeric 
regions. MB.D and other call sets display varying degrees of this 
problem, which may arise if alignment of reads is performed to 
the GRCH37 reference without the d5 decoy sequence and/or no 
ultrahigh-signal blacklist is employed. MB.K overcalls (Fig. 5d) 
but a more subtle pattern is also apparent: higher ploidy chro- 
mosomes (for example, 17) display a greater density of calls and 
lower ploidy chromosomes (8, 15, X and Y) demonstrate a lower 
density of calls, presumably because of coverage. 
Other genomic features such as tandem or interspersed repeats, 
as well as some key sample/sequence/alignment features, also 
create problems for mutation callers but are not detectable at the 
chromosomal scale. We annotated the Gold Set and all submitted 
SSM and SIM calls for each feature, indicating membership 
(Boolean ﬂags) or a score (for continuous characteristics; 
Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). The frequencies or mean scores, 
respectively, were computed for three subsets of each submission 
(TPs, FPs or FNs) and for the Gold Sets. To highlight problematic 
features for each submission, the differences with respect to the 
Gold Set were computed and multiplied by the FP or FN rate, 
accordingly. The problematic features of FPs in the MB SSM data 
set are shown as a heat map (Fig. 6). While nearly all sets of FPs 
are enriched in low-frequency mutations, which are harder to 
discriminate from background noise (also reﬂected by the same 
AF metric), some call sets (MB.K, H, C, D and M) do less well. 
MB.H seems to also have a problem with segmental duplications 
and multimappable regions, and MB.D with duplications only. 
MB.K and MB.M, to a lesser extent, are enriched in SSMs located 
in tandem repeats, simple repeats and homopolymers. MB.C has 
issues with FPs falling in blacklisted regions, speciﬁcally 
centromeric and simple repeats. The three submissions with 
fewer FPs immediately adjacent to tandem repeats than in the 
Gold Set (MB.H, MB.C and MB.D) do not use the Burrows- 
Wheeler Aligner (BWA) for the primary alignment step—instead, 
the mappers Novoalign or GEM are used, or the detection 
method is not based on mapping (SMUFIN30). The 
corresponding heatmaps for MB SSM FNs, and MB FP and FN 
SIMs are shown in Supplementary Figs 15–17. In general, both 
tandem repeats and segmental duplications and interspersed 
repeats cause sensitivity issues, with some pipelines more affected 
than others. The results for SIMs show that SIMs in tandem 
repeats (the majority being homopolymers) are undercalled, 
being under-represented in FPs and over-represented in FNs. 
Interestingly, nested repeats and duplications show the opposite 
trend, indicating that many FPs likely arise from low mapping 
quality. 
Correspondence analysis conﬁrms some of the above ﬁndings 
for MB SSM FPs (Supplementary Fig. 18). MB.C clusters with 
EncMap, dukeMap and centr, suggesting that MB.C FPs occur in 
some blacklisted regions. MB.H (and MB.G and MB.O to lesser 
extent) FPs are associated with segmental duplications. MB.K FPs 
are associated with tandem repeats (and microsatellites and 
simple repeats). 
Effect of mapper on mutation calling. The differences between 
sets of mutations submitted by the participating groups raised 
questions about the impact of individual pipeline components on 
the results. The extent of observed pipeline customization 
(Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Data 1) did not 
allow for exhaustive testing of all potentially important analysis 
steps; however, three pipeline components were selected for closer 
inspection because of their expected high impact: mapper, 
reference genome build and mutation caller. Four mappers 
(Novoalign2, BWA, BWA-mem and GEM), two SSM callers 
(MuTect31 and Strelka) and three versions of the human 
reference genome (b37, b37 decoy and hg19r —a reduced 
version of hg19, with unplaced contigs and haplotypes removed) 
were selected for testing, based on their usage by the 
benchmarking groups (Supplementary Methods for software 
versions and settings). To limit the effect of non-tested software 
on the produced mutation sets, a simple SSM-calling pipeline was 
established. First, we compared the effect of the mapper with each 
of the SSM callers. With a single SSM caller employed, a 
considerable fraction of unﬁltered SSM calls for a given mapper 
(0.22–0.69, depending on the mapper–caller combination) is not 
reproducible by that caller with any other mapper 
(Supplementary Fig. 19). When compared with the Gold Set 
(Tier 3 SSMs), calls supported by a single mapper are almost 
exclusively FPs (precision o0.02). On the other hand, a large 
majority of calls supported by all four mappers are TPs (with 
precision ranging from 0.87 for MuTect to 0.99 for Strelka). 
Effect of primary mutation caller on mutation calling. Similar 
trends are observed when SSM callers are compared while 
holding the mapper constant (Supplementary Table 5). A sizable 
fraction (0.22–0.87, depending on the mapper) of unﬁltered 
SSM calls for any given mapper–caller combination is not 
reproducible by the other caller on the same alignment ﬁle. 
Remarkably, in case of Novoalign2, the same alignment ﬁle leads 
to the most somatic calls and the lowest overall precision when 
used with MuTect, but the fewest somatic calls and highest overall 
precision when used with Strelka. When compared with the Gold 
Set, calls private to a single caller appear to be mostly FPs, with 
precision ranging from 0.01 to 0.05. Calls supported by both 
callers prove to be mostly correct (with precision between 0.89 
and 0.93; Supplementary Table 6). The consensus sets seem to be 
robust—considerably improving the precision rates while only 
minimally lowering the sensitivity. The results of reference 
genome choice and a detailed examination of the alignment 
characteristics of the different aligners are presented in 
Supplementary Note 1. 
Improvement of pipelines using the benchmark data set.Asa

pipelines, we set out to improve the MB.F pipeline further

(already the MB.E pipeline, which uses SomaticSniper, was 
replaced with the MB.F pipeline, which uses Strelka, based on the 
analysis of the CLL benchmark results). Using the Gold Set to 
devise and tune a set of ﬁlters for various metrics (Supplementary 
Table 7), including mapping quality and distance from the end of 
the read alignment block (Supplementary Fig. 20), we are able to 
outperform (in terms of F1) all other MB SSM submissions 
(Fig. 7a and Supplementary Table 8). Despite choosing reason- 
ably conservative thresholds, we were still worried about the 
possibility of overﬁtting; thus, we tested the adjusted pipeline 
on the CLL benchmark data set. We achieved similar results 
(Fig. 7b), demonstrating that the ﬁlter settings work well on at 
least one other cancer type. Removal of the repeat copy ﬁlter 
in Strelka also improve both MB and CLL SIM sensitivity 
without greatly affecting precision (Supplementary Fig. 21 and 
Supplementary Table 8). 
Additional information regarding the CLL benchmark is 
provided in Supplementary Note 1, Supplementary Figs 22–36

Discussion 
This benchmarking exercise has highlighted the importance of 
carefully considering all stages of the laboratory and analysis 
pipelines required to generate consistent and high-quality whole- 
genome data for cancer analysis. In this study we have isolated 
and tested individual library construction/sequencing methods 
and complete analysis pipelines. Analysis pipelines themselves are

also multicomponent; therefore, we have also evaluated mappers 
and two popular mutation callers in isolation. 
By preparing libraries and generating sequence from the same 
MB tumour-normal pair at ﬁve different sequencing centres, we 
obtained results that suggest that PCR-free library preparation 
protocols should be the method of choice to ensure evenness of 
coverage, and that a sequencing depth of close to 100 for both 
tumour and normal ought to be aimed for (particularly 
in situations where subclonal mutations or noncoding alterations 
are suspected to be playing a role). With platforms such as the 
Illumina HiSeq X now coming online in more centres, such an 
increase in coverage may be feasible without dramatically 
increasing costs. 
This exercise also afforded a unique opportunity to compare 
validation schemes for benchmark creation. We found that high- 
depth (B300 ) WGS, in contrast to targeted resequencing, allowed 
us to more accurately assess FN rates in addition to FP rates, as well 
as better enable us to determine sweet spots of pipelines.

difference in frequency with respect to the Gold Set is multiplied by the FP rate. Blue indicates values less than zero and thus the proportion of variants or

ﬁlters (MB.F2 and CLL.F2) are shown as red circles for the medulloblastoma (a) and CLL (b) benchmark GOLD sets. For MB, only the recall versus Tier 3 is 
shown. Overall, 1,019 (81.2%) of the medulloblastoma SSMs (indicated by the dotted line) are considered callable at 40 coverage; 236 MB SSMs 
(18.2%) were not called by any pipeline. For CLL, veriﬁcation was carried out on SSMs originally called on the 40 data, which explains the higher recall.

yielded higher concordance, but still resulted in substantial 
discrepancies in somatic mutation call rates and the calls 
themselves in the hands of different analysis groups. In some 
cases we were able to identify the Achilles heels of pipelines for 
failingtoidentifyorforovercallingmutationsasafunctionof 
genomic features or properties of sequencing depth, quality or 
alignment problems. We found that dominating features of both 
FP and FN SSMs were low coverage in the tumour, and aberrant 
coverage of tumour and normal. Underlying these artefacts are 
features such as segmental duplications and centromeric repeats. 
Use of an appropriate reference sequence (including decoy 
sequences) and/or good use of blacklists (problematic high- 
coverage regions or low mappability) can reduce FPs, while only 
an increase in overall sequencing depth or more sensitive 
algorithms (MuTect, for example) can address the FN rate. In 
contrast, we found that the vast majority of curated SIMs fall in 
simple/tandem repeats, and yet they are often ﬁltered out 
because of a concern that they may be artefacts. We found little 
basis for this concern, at least in our data set that came from a 
no-PCR library. We found that adjustment of ﬁlters related to 
the number of copies of a repeat unit can increase sensitivity for 
this type of mutation. 
Data analysis pipelines are constructed by integrating software 
from diverse sources. We found that the particular choice of a 
pipeline software is not as critical as how each piece of software is 
applied and how the results are ﬁltered. In many instances, 
the approaches used in the different software and the assump- 
tions made therein are not evident to the user and many parts are 
black boxes. We found that certain combinations show much 
higher compatibility than others, for example, with Novoalign 
alignments as input, MuTect produces an SSM call set with the 
lowest overall precision, while the SSM call set produced by 
Strelka on the same alignment ﬁle has the highest overall 
precision. Using combinations of tools for the same process step, 
assuming that a result shared by two different approaches has a 
higher likelihood to be correct, results in higher accuracy32. 
Indeed, we found that some of the higher accuracy pipelines 
utilize consensus of more than one mutation caller. Our 
controlled experiment intersecting Strelka and MuTect calls 
bore this out as well.

To account for many unknowns, variant calling pipeline 
developers often resort to calibrating their pipelines against 
known results, for example from a genotyping experiment 
performed on similar samples. This approach might only have 
limited validity genome-wide, as genotyping assays are typically 
biased towards less complex areas of the genome. We show that 
for cancer WGS experiments our benchmark set has the potential 
to be an unbiased and powerful calibration tool. The sequencing 
reads and curated Gold Set mutations described here are available 
to the research community through the ICGC DACO and the 
EGA to benchmark and calibrate their pipelines. 
The issues that we have addressed in this study must be 
resolved (and we think they can, with the use of our benchmark 
data set) before WGS for cancer analysis can be wholly adopted 
for clinical use. However, we also suggest that further benchmarks 
be established to resolve even more difﬁcult mutational features 
that tumour samples and genomes can present. These include, 
but are not limited to, low sample purity (contamination of 
tumour cells by normal cells and also the normal contaminated 
by tumour cells or viral components), subclonality, structural 
rearrangements and karyotype aberrations. Real cancers are 
complex and this complexity continues to challenge somatic 
mutation calling pipelines. In summary, this valuable resource 
can serve as a useful tool for the comparative assessment of 
sequencing pipelines, and gives important new insights into 
sequencing and analysis strategies as we move into the next big 
expansion phase of the high-throughput sequencing era. 
Methods 
Patient material. An Institutional Review Board ethical vote (Medical Faculty of 
the University of Heidelberg) as well as informed consent were obtained according 
to ICGC the guidelines (www.icgc.org). A limited amount of the original MB DNA 
can be made available on request. 
Library preparation and sequencing. The libraries were prepared at the different 
sequencing centres: the National Center for Genome Analysis (CNAG), Barcelona, 
Spain; the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany; the 
RIKEN Institute, Tokyo, Japan; the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research (OICR), 
Toronto, Canada, and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, UK. Some 
libraries actually comprise a mixture of different libraries (as per the centre s 
standard protocols); others comprise one library only. An overview of the com- 
position of the different libraries and differences in the library preparation pro- 
tocols is given in Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1. All samples were sequenced 
using Illumina technology and chemistry. The majority of reads are of 2 100 bp 
length and are derived from HiSeq2000 or HiSeq2500 sequencers, however, in one 
read set (L.A), a low number of 2 250-bp MiSeq reads are also included. 
Comparison of SSM calls. Each of the participating centres performed mutation 
calling using the respective in house pipelines (Supplementary Methods). 
The raw SSM calls were provided in the form of customized Variant Call Format 
(VCF) ﬁles. To provide a fair comparison, only single base point mutations were 
considered. A call was considered to be equal when both the position and the exact 
substitution reported were identical. The calls were then sorted according to the 
number of centres that made this particular call using a custom Perl script. The 
resulting ﬁle was plotted using a custom R-script (both available on request). 
Merging of the bam ﬁles to get the 300 ﬁles. To create the high coverage 
B300 bam ﬁles, the raw fastq ﬁles were aligned using bwa 0.6.2-r126-tpx aln -t 
12 -q 20, followed by bwa-0.6.2-tpx sample -P -T -t 8 -a 1000 -r. The bam ﬁles for 
each centre/library were merged, and duplicates were marked using Picard tools 
MarkDuplicates Version 1.61. Finally, all merged per-centre bam ﬁles were merged 
using picard-1.95 MergeSamFiles and the header was adjusted using samtools- 
0.1.19 reheader. Since only reads from different libraries were merged at this step, 
duplicates were not marked. The coverage was calculated using an in-house tool, 
taking into account only non-N bases. 
Downsampling of the 300 ﬁles. The B300 bam ﬁles were serially down- 
sampled to different coverage levels (250 ,200 ,150 ,100 ,50 ,30 ,20) 
using picard-1.95 DownsampleSam, and the coverage was determined after each step. 
Determination of library GC bias. To determine the GC bias of the libraries, 
we ﬁrst created 10 kb windows over the whole genome using bedtools (v2.16.2) 
makewindows. Then, the GC content for each window was calculated using 
bedtools (v2.16.2) nuc. Windows containing more than 100 N bases were 
excluded (awk-3.1.6 BEGIN{FS \t }{if ($10 o 100 && $11 o 100) print 
$1"\t"$2"\t"$3"\t"$5} ). Finally, the coverage for each of the remaining windows 
was calculated using bedtools (v2.16.2) multicov. Since the total coverage of the 
different libraries was not the same, the coverage was normalized by dividing the 
coverage for each window by the mean coverage across all windows for each of the 
samples. To visualize the GC bias, we then plotted the normalized coverage against 
the GC content. 
Calculation of low coverage in special regions of interest. The regions of 
interest were deﬁned as previously described33. To determine the percentage of 
bases covered with fewer than 10 reads, we ﬁrst determined the coverage over the 
whole genome in per-base resolution using genomeCoverageBed (v2.16.2) -bga. 
The resulting coverage ﬁle was compressed using bgzip, and an index was produced 
with tabix-0.2.5 -p bed. We then extracted the coverage for our regions of interest 
using tabix-0.2.5. From the resulting extracted coverage ﬁles, we computed the 
number of bases covered by a certain number of reads using intersectBed and a 
custom perl script. This table was then used to determine the percentage of bases 
covered by r10 reads. 
Extraction of mutation signatures. Mutational catalogues were generated based 
on the somatic mutations detected in the tumours. The 30 and 50 sequence context 
of all selected mutations was extracted, and the resulting trinucleotides were 
converted to the pyrimidine context of the substituted base. Considering six 
basic substitution types with surrounding sequence context, this results in a 
mutation-type vector of length 96. The mutational catalogue was set up by 
counting the occurrence of each of these 96 mutation types per sample. 
The proportions of the signatures published by Alexandrov et al.34,35 
contributing to the mutational proﬁle of each sample were estimated based on the 
probabilities of point mutations with their trinucleotide context in the signatures. 
The respective exposures were extracted sample-wise by quadratic programming. 
Exposures were plotted if they accounted for at least 5% of the SSMs in a sample. 
Somatic mutation calling benchmark data set. The sequencing reads provided 
to pipeline benchmark participants were produced at the CNAG using a no-PCR 
library preparation procedure that was adapted from the KAPA Library 
Preparation Kit protocol used together with Illumina TruSeq adaptors and 
omitting PCR ampliﬁcation, each for the MB tumour and the corresponding 
normal DNA sample (L.A). For each sample two libraries were prepared with 
smaller (roughly 300 bases) and larger (roughly 450 bases) insert size. Sizing was 
performed using agarose gel separation and excision of corresponding size bands. 
The two tumour libraries were sequenced to 40.5 and the two normal libraries to 
29.6 using a combination of Illumina HiSeq2000 (2 100 bp) and Illumina 
MiSeq (2 250 bp). MiSeq reads contributed about 2 to each tumour and 
normal data. Reads in the FASTQ format were generated using the RTA software 
provided by Illumina. 
Veriﬁcation by 300 coverage. All reads produced by the different sequencing 
centres on the MB tumour-normal pair (including the CNAG reads described 
above) were combined and analysed to generate a curated set of results (Gold Set). 
The combined sequences gave 314 coverage of the tumour and 272 in the 
normal. Six different teams carried out mutation calling using their pipelines 
(different combinations of aligners, mutation callers and ﬁlters). A consensus set 
was generated accepting all calls made by more than three submitters (a subset of 
10% was reviewed manually to conﬁrm the quality of these calls). All calls made 
by three or fewer submitters were reviewed manually. We generated Integrative 
Genomics Viewer (IGV) screenshots centred on the mutation positions, 
juxtaposing the normal and tumour BWA36 alignments. The images were made 
available for visual inspection and reviewed manually and voted/commented on by 
the entire analysis team (more than eight researchers). For calls that did not achieve 
complete agreement with the reviewers, a ﬁnal decision was reached as follows. 
Reads were aligned with GEM37 (gem-mapper) and converted to the BAM 
format using gemtools scorereads. Alignments were ﬁltered to retain only

left-aligned using GATK. The pileups at SSM positions were extracted using 
samtools mpileup with base-quality threshold Z13. Read depth and base counts 
were extracted using a custom script. Mutant allele and normal counts were 
compared using in-house software snape-cmp-counts38, which compares alternate 
and reference allele counts in tumour and normal and then assigns a score 
according to the probability that they are derived from different beta distributions. 
Mappabilities with 0, 1 and 2% mismatches were computed for the reference 
genome (h37d5). The average mappabilities in 100-bp windows preceding each 
candidate mutation were stored as tracks for visualization in IGV. In addition, the 
segmental duplication annotation from the UCSC browser was loaded into IGV. 
Mutations were then classiﬁed as follows. Mutations with sufﬁcient depth (Z20) 
and a snape-cmp-counts score Z0.98, average mappability of one and no overlap 
with segmental duplications were automatically classiﬁed in the Gold Set according 
to their mutant AF (class 1: MAFZ0.1, class 2: 0.14MAFZ0.05 or class 3: 
MAFo0.05). All other candidates with snape-cmp-counts score 40.9 were 
reviewed visually in IGV. At this point, extensive soft-clipping in BWA, obvious 
strand bias and positional bias were also taken into consideration. Mutations with 
ambiguous alignments were assigned to class 4. Abnormally low or high depth 
mutations (taking also into account large-scale copy number variant regions) were 
assigned to class 5. Somatic mutation Gold Set tiers were compiled by cumulative 
addition of classes so that Tier 1 only includes class 1, while Tier 2 includes class 1 
and class 2, Tier 3 includes classes 1, 2 and 3 and so on. All other candidate 
mutations were rejected and assigned to class 0 (Table 1). The estimated mutation 
AF cutoff is 2%, below which we deemed a call unreliable. The Gold Set was made 
available to all participants to review why a somatic mutation was wrongly called or 
missed in their respective submission. 
Evaluation of submissions. Automatic validation was performed on the 
submission server to minimize formatting problems. In addition, the submitted 
VCF ﬁles were sorted, ﬁltered to restrict calls to chromosomes 1–22, X and Y and 
SIMs were left-aligned. Submissions of both CLL and MB SSMs and SIMs were 
evaluated against their respective Gold Sets, whose derivation is described above. 
For calculation of recall, the curated mutations were classiﬁed into three tiers 
according to alternate (mutation) AF. Only positions were considered, not the 
genotypes reported. For calculation of precision, all Tier 3 mutations plus 
ambiguously aligned mutations (class 4) were included so as to not penalize 
difﬁcult to align but otherwise convincing differences between tumour and normal 
samples. For SIMs, no stratiﬁcation into tiers 2 or 3 was performed; for recall, Tier 
1 SIMs were used while, for precision, Tier 4 SIMs were used. To compare overall 
performance, we used a balanced measure of accuracy, the F1 score, deﬁned as 
2 (Precision Recall)/(Precision Recall). 
Overlap calculations for the purpose of clustering and heat map generation were 
performed using Tier 3 for SSMs and Tier 1 for SIMs. The Jaccard index is deﬁned 
as the intersection divided by the union. 
Correspondence analysis was performed using the ca package in R on a table 
where each row corresponds to a genomic position at which at least one submission 
calls a somatic mutation in the Gold Set. The columns comprise the presence or 
absence in each call set, and Boolean values indicating whether certain genomic 
features such as repeats or presence in a blacklisted region apply, as well as 
sequence data such as AF or depth. 
Rainfall plots represent the distance for each SSM call from its immediately 
prior SSM on the reference genome. For each submission, the SSM set used was 
made of SSM called classiﬁed as TP or FP and SSM from the Gold Set Tier 4 that 
were absent from the submission, classiﬁed as FN positions. 
Feature analysis was conducted as follows. Tandem repeats were annotated with 
two programmes. Tandem repeats ﬁnder39 was run on 201-bp windows around 
each SSM and SIM calls. Any repeats greater than or equal to six repeat units 
overlapping or immediately adjacent to the mutation position was annotated 
accordingly. SGA25 was also used to annotate homopolymers speciﬁcally, giving a 
richer annotation of the repeat context and change induced by the mutation. 
Mappability was calculated using gem mappability40 with one mismatch at both 
100mer and 150mer lengths. The average 100mer and 150mer mappabilities for 
each mutation were calculated for a window of 90 to 10 or 140 to 10 
with respect to its position, respectively. Mult100 and mult150 are deﬁned as 
1—mappability 100 and 150. Same AF is deﬁned as 1 (2 (SCOREsnape-cmp-counts 
0.5)) for SCOREZ0.5 else 0. 
Control of pipeline components. The protocol consisted of choosing a genome 
reference, mapping, alignment processing, variant calling and then analysis of 
alignments or variant calls.

Mutation callers tested: 
MuTect31 (v. 1.1.4; dbSNP v. 138; COSMIC v. 64) 
Strelka27 (1.0.13) 
Alignment post-processing ensuring format compatibility with the downstream 
tools was performed as follows: 
Merge multiple SAM/BAM output ﬁles, coordinate-sorting of alignments with 
Picard tools (v. 1.84) 
Add read group information with Picard tools 
Discard secondary alignments (alignments with SAM FLAG 0 100 set) with 
samtools (v. 0.1.18) ( samtools view -h -b -F 256 ) 
Mark duplicates with Picard tools MarkDuplicates. 
Realignment (RealignerTargetCreator, IndelRealigner) around indels with 
GATK (v. 2.3-9-ge5ebf34). The tumour and control were processed together. 
Apply Picard tools FixMateInformation 
No base-quality recalibration or mutation ﬁltration was applied. Two hundred 
ﬁfty-one-nucleotide-long reads mapped by Novoalign were truncated to 150 
nucleotides; this affected B4.4% of tumour reads (causing possible FNs because of 
missing mutation support in the tumour) and B4.5% of control reads (causing 
possible FPs because of missing mutation evidence in the control). 
The programme qProﬁler (http://sourceforge.net/p/adamajava/wiki/qProﬁler/) 
was run on each mapper s alignment ﬁles to investigate systematic mapping 
differences that potentially inﬂuenced subsequent mutation calling. Speciﬁcally, 
distributions of values in SAM ﬁelds RNAME (alignment reference sequence ID), 
MAPQ (alignment mapping quality score), TLEN (observed insert size), 
CIGAR (alignment-level indel details together with soft clippings —mapper- 
induced read trimming) and MD (alignment mismatch details) were of interest. 
The same alignment ﬁles were used for mutation calling and qproﬁler analysis. 
However, since mutation calling results were limited to chromosomes 1–22, X and 
Y, alignment ﬁles serving as qproﬁler input were ﬁrst ﬁltered so as to contain only 
alignments to chromosomes 1–22, X and Y in order for the statistics being relevant 
(contig coverage statistics being the only exception, since mapping to the decoy 
contig appears to be important).
