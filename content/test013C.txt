Abstract 
Retroviruses are not expected to encode miRNAs because of the potential problem of self-cleav- 
age of their genomic RNAs. This assumption has recently been challenged by experiments 
showing that bovine leukemia virus (BLV) encodes miRNAs from intragenomic Pol III promoters. 
The BLV miRNAs are abundantly expressed in B-cell tumors in the absence of significant levels 
of genomic and subgenomic viral RNAs. Using deep RNA sequencing and functional reporter 
assays, we show that miRNAs mediate the expression of genes involved in cell signaling, can- 
cer and immunity. We further demonstrate that BLV miRNAs are essential to induce B-cell 
tumors in an experimental model and to promote efficient viral replication in the natural host. 
Author Summary 
The recent discovery of miRNA expression by retroviruses is a matter of active debate and 
some controversy. Several retroviruses including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
potentially encode functional small non-coding RNAs that are nevertheless undetectable 
in vivo. While these miRNAs regulate multiple host and viral processes in vitro, their con- 
tribution to infection and pathogenesis remains largely unknown. Using next-generation 
sequencing and reverse genetics, we provide mechanistic and functional evidence demon- 
strating that BLV miRNAs are functional genetic elements that regulate replication and 
contribute to oncogenesis in suitable animal models. 
Introduction 
Virally encoded miRNAs were first identified in DNA viruses. Most of these miRNAs are 
generated from endonucleolytic cleavage of long viral transcripts. Retroviruses were initially

assumed not to encode miRNAs because of the potential self-cleavage of their RNA genome. 
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), West Nile virus (WNV), Dengue virus (DENV), hepa- 
titis A virus (HAV) and Ebola virus (EBOV) potentially express small non-coding RNAs [1–4]; 
however, no significant amounts of viral miRNAs have been identified by high-throughput 
sequencing of RNA from cultured cells infected with these different viruses [5–7]. Recently, 
four retroviruses, i.e., bovine leukemia virus (BLV), bovine foamy virus (BFV), avian leucosis 
virus (ALV-J) and simian foamy virus (SFV) were shown to express viral miRNAs in infected 
cells [8–11]. ALV-J encodes a single viral miRNA (XSR) from a Pol II-transcribed precursor 
that is processed by the canonical biogenesis pathway. ALV-J thus tolerates some Drosha and 
Dicer cis-cleavage of the viral genome. In contrast, BLV and BFV massively express viral miR- 
NAs driven by Pol III promoters embedded within their proviral genome. These viruses avoid 
unproductive cleavage of their genomic RNA because only the subgenomic Pol III transcripts 
are processed into miRNAs. The BFV long terminal repeat U3 region is transcribed into a 
122-nucleotide pri-miRNA that is subsequently cleaved into two pre-miRNAs and processed 
in three viral miRNAs. The BLV genome encodes a cluster of five miRNA hairpins from a pro- 
viral region lacking significant open reading frames located just 3' to the envelope gene. These 
hairpins undergo maturation into ten miRNAs in a Drosha-independent pathway [8,12,13]. 
BLV naturally infects the bovine species (Bos taurus), zebu (Bos indicus) and water buffalo 
(Bubalus bubalis). BLV infection remains mostly asymptomatic in a large majority of infected 
animals. Only approximately one-third of BLV-infected cows will develop benign lymphocyto- 
sis. In a minority of cases (approximately 5%), BLV infection leads to B-cell leukemia/lym- 
phoma after long latency periods (7–10 years). Experimental inoculation of sheep with BLV 
recapitulates the different steps of oncogenesis with higher frequencies (up to 100%) and rela- 
tively short latency periods (approximately 2 years) [14]. Remarkably, BLV persists and repli- 
cates in vivo in the absence of significant levels of viral mRNA transcription [15–17]. In 
contrast, BLV miRNAs are massively expressed in the infected cells, representing up to approx- 
imately 40% of all cellular miRNAs [12]. Because ribonucleic acids are likely less immunogenic 
than viral antigens, BLV miRNAs could thus modify the cell fate and concomitantly escape 
from immune recognition. 
Although miRNAs encoded by BLV are massively expressed, their biological significance in 
viral replication and pathogenesis is still unknown. In this report, we specifically addressed this 
question in the BLV system using a reverse genetics approach. 
Results 
BLV miRNAs modulate the expression of genes involved in 
oncogenesis, cell signaling, apoptosis and immune response 
To investigate the role of the miRNAs in the natural host, a BLV provirus isogenic to a wild- 
type molecular clone but devoid of the intergenic sequences located between the env and R3 
genes (pBLV- miRNA) was constructed (Fig 1A) and inoculated into 3 calves. All three ani- 
mals produced specific antibodies against BLV gp51 envelope protein and became persistently 
infected by the deleted virus, demonstrating that the miRNAs are dispensable for infectivity. 
Serial PCR amplifications of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) DNA with primers 
flanking the miRNA region and subsequent sequencing confirmed that pBLV- miRNA was 
indeed infectious in vivo (Fig 1B). Quantitative RT-qPCR further revealed the lack of viral 
miRNA expression in these animals (B1-3p, B2-5p, B3-3p, B4-3p and B5-5p), as in a control 
bovine B-lymphocyte cell line (BL3) (Fig 1C). In contrast, the miRNA copy numbers measured 
in primary PBMCs from wild-type infected calves (Bo-WT) were similar to the levels of BL3 
cells transduced with a lentiviral vector expressing the BLV miRNAs (BL3-miRNA, Fig 1C).

Because a minimal heptameric seed sequence is sufficient for activity, the ten BLV miRNAs 
are predicted to substantially modify the host transcriptome. To address species-specificity, cell 
type adequacy and biological relevance, gene expression was characterized in parallel in pri- 
mary PBMCs and miRNA-transduced BL3 lymphocytes. High-throughput RNA sequencing 
was performed with pLenti-miRNA-transduced BL3 cells (BL3-miRNA) or control pLenti- 
transduced BL3 (BL3) and with PBMCs from wild-type BLV (Bo-WT), pBLV- miRNA (Bo- 
miRNA) or mock-infected calves. Fig 2A illustrates the expression coverage profile corre- 
sponding to the granzyme A (GZMA) locus. GZMA mRNA was expressed in control lympho- 
cytes (BL3) but not in pLenti-miRNA-transduced BL3 cells (BL3-miRNA). Consistently, 
GZMA transcripts were present in PBMCs from pBLV- miRNA-inoculated animals (Bo- 
miRNA) and uninfected controls but were almost undetectable in Bo-WT calves (Fig 2A). 
The combined analysis of BL3 cells and PBMCs thus identified mRNAs associated with the 
presence of the miRNAs in B lymphocytes and in vivo. Panel B of Fig 2 provides the top list of 
mRNAs that match these criteria. Gene ontology analysis using MSigDB software (Molecular 
Signature DataBase from the Broad Institute) identified a network of the most enriched path- 
ways that included cell signaling, cancer genes and immune response (Fig 2C). 
FOS, GZMA and PPT1 are biologically relevant miRNA targets 
The expression networks of statistically significant and biologically relevant genes revealed 
intramodular hubs in consensus modules (Fig 2C). Based on their connection frequency, the 
following six hub genes were selected for further functional analysis (boxes on Fig 2C): PPT1 
(palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1), ANXA1 (annexin A1), GZMA (granzyme A), PIK3CG 
(phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit gamma), FOS (FBJ murine 
osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog) and MAP2K1 (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 
1 or MEK1). BLV miRNA functionality was evaluated in BL3 cells by reporter constructs con- 
taining gene cDNAs cloned downstream of the Renilla luciferase gene. BLV miRNAs silenced 
the luciferase activity of reporter plasmids containing the full-length cDNAs of FOS, GZMA 
and PPT1 (compare BL3-miRNA with BL3 on Fig 3A). As a control for specificity, luciferase 
expression of a backbone reporter lacking cDNAs was unaffected by BLV miRNAs (S3 Fig). In 
contrast, ANXA1, MAP2K1 and PIK3CG reporters were not down-regulated under similar 
conditions, indicating that these genes were not direct miRNA targets (Fig 3A). The FOS, 
GZMA and PPT1 mRNAs were predicted by Sfold and STarMiRNA software to be direct inter- 
actors of miRNA B4-3p (Fig 3G and S1 Fig). Mutation of the predicted miRNA binding sites in 
the full-length cDNAs of FOS, GZMA and PPT1 abrogated miRNA silencing (Fig 3B). To test 
the selective effect of BLV miRNA B4 on the FOS, GZMA and PPT1 mRNAs, HEK293T cells 
were transfected with a pSUPER plasmid encoding only miRNA B4 (Fig 3C–3F). The levels of 
miRNA expression achieved in HEK293T cells were biologically relevant as they were similar 
to those measured in PBMCs (S2 Fig). BLV miRNA B4 silenced the luciferase activity of 
reporter plasmids containing the full-length cDNAs of FOS, GZMA and PPT1 (compare pSU- 
PER with pSUPER-B4 on Fig 3C). Mutation of the predicted miRNA binding sites in the full- 
length cDNAs of FOS, GZMA and PPT1 abrogated the miRNA B4 silencing (Fig 3D). Insertion

of the predicted target (Fig 3E) but not of a mutated version (Fig 3F) in the 3'UTR of the lucif- 
erase gene recapitulated the silencing activity of the miRNAs. 
These functional reporter assays thus identified direct (FOS, GZMA and PPT1) and indirect 
(ANXA1, MAP2K1 and PIK3CG) targets among biologically relevant genes whose expression 
is affected by BLV miRNAs in vivo. 
BLV miRNAs are dispensable for infection but contribute to viral 
replication in the natural host 
To evaluate the role of the miRNAs in viral fitness, 12 calves were inoculated either with the 
wild-type molecular clone or with the recombinant pBLV- miRNA. The proviral loads profile 
indicated that the viral burden at 28–30 days post-inoculation was significantly lower in pBLV- 
miRNA infected animals compared to wild-type levels (Fig 4A Mann-Whitney test, p = 0.04). 
The integrity of the miRNAs was also important to maintain stable proviral loads in the long 
term (i.e., at 252–254 days on Fig 4A; Mann Whitney test, p = 0.03). Nested PCR and sequenc- 
ing indicated the absence of reversion of the mutation at any time post-infection (S4 Fig). Con- 
sistently, spontaneous ex-vivo transcription of viral mRNAs was reduced in the animals 
infected with pBLV- miRNA compared to wild-type levels (Fig 4B Mann Whitney test, 
p = 0.009, p = 0.004 and p = 0.002 for GAG, ENV and TAX, respectively). miRNAs were abun- 
dantly expressed in PBMCs (Fig 4C) as well as in the plasma (Fig 4D) of wild-type BLV- 
infected calves and correlated with proviral loads but were undetectable in the pBLV- miRNA 
deletants. The expression of miRNA-regulated transcripts ANXA1, FOS, GZMA, MAP2K1, 
PPT1 and PIK3CG further validated the transcriptomic profiling data in a larger series of ani- 
mals (Fig 4E). 
Together, these observations demonstrate that ablation of the BLV miRNAs impacts repli- 
cation fitness in the natural host. 
Suppression of oncogenicity in the absence of BLV miRNAs 
Due to the low frequency of tumor development and the long latency period, the evaluation of 
the role of miRNAs in oncogenesis in the bovine species would take decades. Although sheep 
are not naturally infected by BLV, this model recapitulates the main characteristics of bovine 
leukemia-lymphoma and allows one to address this important question. Replication efficacy of 
the wild-type and pBLV- miRNA viruses was initially similar during early stages post-inocula- 
tion (NS, Fig 5A). At later times, the miRNA deletant was unable to maintain wild-type replica- 
tion ( p = 0.04 according to the Mann Whitney test). The levels of miRNA expression in 
PBMCs and in the plasma were similar to those measured in the calves (Fig 5B and 5C). Since 
BLV miRNAs are abundantly expressed in the plasma, GZMA transcription could be affected 
in other cell types (CTLs and NK cells). Cell sorting and RT-qPCR demonstrated that miRNA- 
associated GZMA down-regulation is restricted to the B cell lineage (S4 Fig). As in the bovine

species, replication of the pBLV- miRNA deletant in sheep occurred in the absence of rever- 
sion (S5 Fig). Fifty percent of the sheep infected with wild-type BLV developed leukemia-lym- 
phoma within 22 months, confirming previous rates reported in the literature (Fig 5D)[18]. 
Compared to the high incidence of leukemia-lymphoma in the sheep inoculated with parental 
BLV, none of the animals infected with pBLV- miRNA displayed any clinical sign of oncoge- 
nicity (Fig 5D). 
These data thus reveal a dramatic suppression of oncogenicity subsequent to the loss of 
BLV miRNAs. 
Discussion 
The high abundance of BLV miRNAs in tumors suggested a possible role in viral replication 
and oncogenesis [8,12]. In this report, we have provided mechanistic and functional evidence 
demonstrating that the BLV miRNAs modify host gene expression to promote viral persistence 
and induce pathogenicity. The goal of the transcriptomic analysis was to identify the global 
changes associated with the BLV miRNAs in the natural host. The rationale was based on the 
merged analysis of a well-characterized cell system (BL3 bovine cells transduced with miRNAs) 
and primary PBMCs isolated from infected cows. The main reason of this strategy is that unbi- 
ased isolation of BLV-infected B cells from an infected animal is technically still impossible. 
Therefore, RNA sequencing was performed in parallel with miRNA or mock-transduced BL3 
cells and primary PBMCs from cows inoculated with wild-type or recombinant pBLV- 
miRNA viruses. The objective was not to produce an exhaustive list of direct RNA targets but 
rather monitor the global effect of the miRNAs. High-throughput sequencing of RNA isolated 
from immunoprecipitated Ago-miRNA-mRNA complexes would identify only direct BLV 
miRNA targets. Transcriptomic profiling by high throughput RNA sequencing identified 
genes whose expression is affected by miRNAs in B-lymphocytes and primary PBMCs (Fig 
2B). This approach revealed a list of biologically relevant genes that are directly (GZMA, FOS, 
PPT1) or indirectly (ANXA1, MAP2K1 and PIK3CG) targeted by the BLV miRNAs (Fig 3). In 
contrast, peroxidasin homolog (PXDN) identified by miRNA/RNA duplex prediction analyses 
and reporter assays was not a biologically relevant miRNA target in vivo [8,12]. Similarly, 
tumor suppressor HMGbox transcription factor 1 (HBP1) whose expression is halved in sheep 
tumor cells [12] is unaffected in bovine B-lymphocytes expressing the BLV miRNAs (S6 Fig). 
Gene ontology analysis revealed intramodular hubs in two consensus modules that relate to 
apoptosis and immunity (GZMA, PPT1 and ANXA1) or cell signaling and oncogenesis (FOS, 
MAP2K1 and PIK3CG). In particular, the serine protease GZMA expressed mostly by natural 
killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) but also by B cells under inflammatory 
conditions [19], induces caspase-independent apoptosis [20,21]. Knockout of GZMA in mouse 
models sensitizes to the animals viral infections, indicating a central role in immunity [22]. 
Inactivation of GZMA by Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV) miRNA-K12-6 
further supports the significance of this target in other viral life cycles [23]. Our data (S4 Fig) 
show that GZMA expression is reduced by BLV miRNAs in B-lymphocytes but not in non-B 
cells. It remains nevertheless possible that microRNAs are transiently transferred via the

target is FOS, which mediates the primary response to B-cell receptor signaling upon dimeriza-

repressed by KSHV-encoded miRNA-K12-11 in lymphoma B-cells [23,30], illustrating com- 
mon pathways of virus-induced oncogenesis. A third hub transcript that directly interacts with 
BLV miRNAs is PPT1, a glycoprotein involved in the catabolism of lipid-modified proteins 
during lysosomal degradation. PPT1 removes thioester-linked fatty acyl groups from cysteine 
residues and modulates tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) signaling [31]. Because PPT1-defi- 
cient fibroblasts are partially resistant to TNF-induced cell death, BLV miRNAs could promote 
survival via this pathway [31]. RNA sequencing also revealed a series of genes whose expression 
is modified by pathways not involving direct seed-to-target interactions such as ANXA1, a 
mediator of macrophage phagocytosis. Together, the experimental data from this report and 
evidence from the literature highlight common mechanisms of transformation shared by other 
DNA viruses or those involved in human leukemia. 
Assessing the role of viral miRNAs in cell lines faces objections of biological relevance in 
vivo. Transduction of BLV miRNAs into the BL3 cell line was not associated with alterations of 
cell proliferation or apoptosis (S7 Fig). BLV miRNAs do not directly impact on viral mRNAs 
or proteins in vitro (S8 Fig). In contrast, ablation of the miRNAs had significant effects on viral 
replication in the natural host (Fig 4). Compared to the wild-type controls, the proviral loads 
associated with miRNA deletants were indeed significantly lower during the primary infection 
and decreased regularly in the long-term. Whether miRNAs deletion will ultimately lead to an 
abortive infection remains to be determined but is predicted to require extensive periods of sev- 
eral years. Notwithstanding, a decrease in viral burden correlates with a reduction in viral 
transmission as well as pathogenicity. Consistently, our preliminary evidence indicates that the 
miRNA deletant does not transmit from cow-to-calf (S9 Fig). Considering the low frequency 
(5%) and long latency period (7–10 years) of tumor development in the natural host, assessing 
the role of the miRNAs in the bovine species is an interesting but almost unanswerable ques- 
tion. Nevertheless, observations in the sheep experimental model indicate that BLV miRNAs 
contribute to leukemogenesis (Fig 5). Because sheep develop a leukemia/lymphoma that closely 
mimics natural pathogenesis, BLV miRNAs are speculated to be important mediators of onco- 
genesis in the bovine species. It should be mentioned that the reduced proviral load observed 
in the pBLV- miRNA-infected animals is likely to cause reduced pathogenicity. In fact, it is 
not possible to dissociate both parameters in vivo since development of leukemia positively 
correlates with proviral loads in the PBMCs [32,33]. Whether BLV miRNAs exert a direct 
oncogenic role by targeting specific cellular transcripts independently of viral replication 
remains to be demonstrated. 
A role of viral miRNAs in pathogenesis has important consequences for the safety of an 
anti-BLV vaccine that is currently under development [34]. Considering the evidence reported 
here, a safe live-attenuated vaccine should also include a deletion of the miRNAs to limit the 
risk of disease. Another consequence of this report relates to human health, although this topic 
is still controversial [35,36]. Because viral (BLV miRNA B4) and cellular (miRNA-29) miRNAs 
share identical seed sequences, there is also a potential threat for zoonotic-induced oncogene- 
sis, as recently suggested by the association of BLV and breast cancer [37]. 
Materials and Methods 
Construction and inoculation of the miRNA-deleted provirus 
Plasmid pBLV-WT (GenBank: JC613347.1) contains an infectious and pathogenic wild-type 
BLV provirus (strain 344). An isogenic molecular clone (pBLV -miRNA) was constructed by 
deleting pBLV-WT of the miRNA coding region (nucleotides 6170 to 6736 according to the 
BLV reference genome NC_001414.1) (see S1 Text). Calves and sheep were inoculated by sub- 
cutaneous injection of pBLV-WT or pBLV -miRNA as described in reference [38]. At regular

intervals of time, heparinized blood was collected by jugular venipuncture and an aliquot of 
plasma was cryopreserved. PBMCs were isolated by Lymphoprep density gradient centrifuga- 
tion (Stemcell technologies), resuspended in fetal calf serum containing 10% DMSO (Sigma- 
Aldrich) and frozen at -80°C or in liquid nitrogen. 
Transcriptomic analysis 
The BLV sequences corresponding to the miRNA region (nucleotides 6170 to 6759 of the refer- 
ence BLV genome NC_001414.1) were inserted into a lentiviral vector (pLenti6, Life technolo- 
gies) to construct pLenti-miRNA. HEK 293T cells were transfected using lipofectamine 2000 
(Life Technologies) with pLenti6 or pLenti-miRNA vectors together with pCAG-HIVgp and 
pCMV-VSV-G-RSV-Rev (provided by Masahiro Fujii, Niigata University, Japan). Forty-eight 
hours after transfection, the supernatant was collected and incubated with BL3 cells in presence 
of polybrene (10 g/ml). BL3 is a bovine B cell line with lymphoblastic morphology derived 
from a naturally occurred lymphosarcoma [39]. After selection with blasticidin (10 g/ml), cor- 
rect miRNA expression in BL3-miRNA cells was verified by RT-qPCR. Total RNA was isolated 
from 3 independent batches of BL3 and BL3-miRNA cells using the miRNANeasy kit (Qiagen). 
In parallel, RNA was also extracted in triplicate from bovine PBMCs isolated from pBLV-WT, 
pBLV- miRNA and mock- infected calves (3 animals in each category). Proviral loads in 100 
PBMCs of these animals were comparable: 4, 0.4 and 5.5 copies (pBLV-WT) and 2.3, 1.5 and 
1.7 copies (pBLV- miRNA). Truseq Stranded mRNA libraries were prepared according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina) and indexed 100bp paired-end runs were acquired on a 
HiSeq2000 Illumina sequencer. After mapping of the reads with the Tophat software, differen- 
tial expression analysis was performed with Cufflinks. 
Construction of effector/sensor plasmids and luciferase reporter assays 
Details on plasmid constructions are provided in the Supporting Information file S1 Text. 
After extraction of BL3 RNA, reverse transcription and PCR amplification, a series of lucifer- 
ase reporter plasmids (ANXA1, GZMA, FOS, MAP2K1, PIK3CG and PPT1) were con- 
structed by inserting the full-length bovine cDNA sequences into psiCHECK2 (Promega). 
Mutations of the predicted target sequences in these reporter plasmids were introduced 
using the Q5 directed mutagenesis kit (NEB). Reporter constructs (500ng) were transfected 
into 200,000 BL3 or BL3-miRNA cells using the Neon Transfection System (ThermoFisher 
Scientific). Electroporation parameters included 3 pulses of 1350V during 10ms. Effector 
plasmid pSUPER-miRNA was constructed by cloning the five miRNA hairpins (nucleotides 
6170 to 6759 of the BLV reference genome NC_001414.1) into BglII and HindIII sites of 
expression vector pSUPER (Oligoengine). pSUPER-B4 only contains the miRNA-B4 hairpin 
(nucleotides 6484 to 6664). Reporter (100ng) and effector (500ng) constructs were trans- 
fected with Lipofectamine 2000 into 200,000 HEK 293T cells (293T/17; ATCC CRL-11268) 
in a 24 well plate. After 24 hours, cells were lysed and luciferase activities were measured 
using the Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions. Assays were carried out in independent biological triplicates. See S1 Text for 
primers used for cloning. 
Quantification of proviral loads 
DNA was extracted from PBMCs using DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen). BLV sequences 
were PCR amplified using pol gene sequence-specific primers 5'-GAAACTCCAGAGCAAT 
GGCATAA-3' and 5'-GGTTCGGCCATCGAGACA-3'. As reference for quantification, 
β-actin was amplified with oligonucleotides 5'-TCCCTGGAGAAGAGCTACGA-3’ and

Roche light cycler using MESA green master mix (Eurogentec). The thermal protocol was initi- 
ated by a 5 min denaturation step at 95°C, followed by 45 cycles (15 sec at 95°C, 20 sec at 60°C, 
40 sec at 72°C) and terminated by a melting curve. PCR efficiencies were calculated for each 
sample using 100ng, 33ng and 11ng of DNA. Standard curves were generated using PCR4topo 
vectors (Life Technologies) containing the corresponding pol or actin amplicon. Proviral load 
was calculated, as an average of the three dilutions, from the number of proviral copies divided 
by half of the number of actin copies and expressed as number of proviral copies per 100 of 
PBMCs. 
Nested PCR of proviral sequences 
One hundred nanograms of genomic DNA were used for the first round of PCR using primers 
(Fw 5’-GCTTGACCTCTCGCCTTTTA-3’; Rv GTGCCGAGGTGGAAATAGAA), Phusion 
hot start II High Fidelity DNA polymerase and High Fidelity buffer (NEB). Thermal cycling 
conditions were: 30 sec at 98°C; 35 cycles (98°C 5 sec, 63°C 10 sec, 72°C 30 sec); 2 min at 72°C. 
One microliter of a 10-fold dilution of first round PCR was used as template for the second 
round PCR using primers (nFw 5’-CCCCTAAACCCGATTCTGAT-3’; nRv 5’-GGGCTTGTT 
ACATGGGAAGA-3’). Thermal protocol for nested PCR were: 30 sec at 98°C, 35 cycles (5 sec 
at 98°C, 10 sec at 62°C, 30 sec at 72°C), 2 min at 72°C. Actin gene DNA was amplified with 
primers (Fw 5’-TCCCTGGAGAAGAGCTACGA-3’ and Rv 5’-GGCAGACTTAGCCT 
CCAGTG-3’) from 100 ng of genomic DNA according to the cycling protocol: 30 sec at 98°C 
followed by 35 cycles of (5 sec at 98°C /10 sec at 64°C / 30 sec at 72°C) and terminated by 
2 min at 72°C.

PBMCs were cultivated during 24 hours in RPMI medium supplemented with L-glutamine, 
antibiotics, 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 0.2 M of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), 
0.5 M of ionomycin, 0.1 M of concanamycin A (Sigma Aldrich). HEK293T were transfected 
with plasmids pBLV-WT or pBLV -miRNA using lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) and 
cultivated during 48 hours in RPMI medium supplemented with L-glutamine, antibiotics and 
10% FCS. Total RNA was extracted from ex vivo cultivated PBMCs and transfected HEK293T

Quantification of BLV microRNA 
Total RNA of HEK293T, YR2 and PBMCs was extracted using the miRNeasy kit (Qiagen), 
incubated with Turbo DNAse kit (Life Technologies) and reverse transcribed using the Taq- 
man microRNA Reverse transcription kit (Life Technologies) and stem-loop custom BLV 
microRNA specific primers (Life Technologies). To generate HPRT cDNA, 1.5 pmol of primer 
5’-AAGGGCATATCCCACAACAAAC-3’ was added at the end of the reverse transcription 
step and incubated for 10 min at 50°C. cDNA was PCR amplified in a Roche light cycler with 
HPRT primers (5’-GGTCAAGAAGCATAAACCAAAG-3’ and 5’-AAGGGCATATCCCAC 
AACAAAC-3’) and custom Taqman BLV microRNA probes (Life Technologies) using MESA 
green master mix (Eurogentec) or Taqman Universal Master Mix II (Life Technologies), 
respectively. The thermal protocol used for microRNA quantification started with a denatur- 
ation step at 95°C for 10min followed by 45 PCR cycles (15 sec at 95°C, 60 sec at 60°C). For 
HPRT, PCR cycles included 5 min denaturation at 95°C followed by 45 cycles of PCR (15 sec at
