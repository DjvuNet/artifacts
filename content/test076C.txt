Abstract
Background
Berberine is used to treat diabetes and dyslipidemia. However, the effect of berberine on 
specific diabetes treatment targets is unknown. In the current study, we investigated the 
effect of berberine on the random plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C), AST, 
ALT, BUN and CREA levels of Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats, and we identified and veri-
fied the importance of potential therapeutic target genes to provide molecular information for 
further investigation of the mechanisms underlying the anti-diabetic effects of berberine.
Methods
ZDF rats were randomly divided into control (Con), diabetic (DM) and berberine-treated 
(300 mg-kg   , BBR) groups. After the ZDF rats were treated with BBR for 12 weeks, its 
effect on the random plasma glucose and HbA1C levels was evaluated. Aspartate amino-
transferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), CREA and 
OGTT were measured from blood, respectively. The levels of gene expression in liver sam-
ples were analyzed using an Agilent rat gene expression 4x44K microarray. The differen-
tially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened as those with log2 (Con vs DM) 2: 1 and log2 
(BBR vs DM) 2: 1 expression levels, which were the genes with up-regulated expression, 
and those with log2 (Con vs DM) :s -1 and log2 (BBR vs DM) :s -1 expression levels, which 
were the genes with down-regulated expression; the changes in gene expression were con-
sidered significant at P<0.05. The functions of the DEGs were determined using gene ontol-
ogy (GO) and pathway analysis. Furthermore, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network 
was constructed using STRING and Cytoscape software. The expression levels of the key 
node genes in the livers of the ZDF rats were also analyzed using qRT-PCR.

Results
We found that 12 weeks of berberine treatment significantly decreased the random 
plasma glucose, HbA1C levels and improved glucose tolerance. There was a tendency 
for berberine to reduce AST, ALT, BUN except increase CREA levels. In the livers of the 
BBR group, we found 154 DEGs, including 91 genes with up-regulated expression and 63 
genes with down-regulated expression. In addition, GO enrichment analysis showed sig-
nificant enrichment of the DEGs in the following categories: metabolic process, localiza-
tion, cellular process, biological regulation and response to stimulus process. After the 
gene screening, KEGG pathway analysis showed that the target genes are involved in 
multiple pathways, including the lysine degradation, glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis-
chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate and pyruvate metabolism pathways. By combining 
the results of PPI network and KEGG pathway analyses, we identified seven key node 
genes. The qRT-PCR results confirmed that the expression of the RHOA, MAPK4 and 
DLAT genes was significantly down-regulated compared with the levels in DM group, 
whereas the expression of the SgK494, DOT1L, SETD2 and ME3 genes was significantly 
up-regulated in the BBR group.
Conclusion
Berberine can significantly improve glucose metabolism and has a protective effects of liver 
and kidney function in ZDF rats. The qRT-PCR results for the crucial DEGs validated the 
microarray results. These results suggested that the RHOA, MAPK4, SGK494, DOT1L, 
SETD2, ME3 and DLAT genes are potential therapeutic target genes for the treatment of 
diabetes.
Introduction
Diabetes mellitus (DM), which is characterized by disordered lipid metabolism and a high cir-
culating blood glucose level, is a metabolic syndrome [1]. The main form of diabetes found in 
90~95% of diabetic patients globally is type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) [2]. Diabetes can cause 
many complications, including neuropathy, nephropathy and retinopathy [3]. Diabetes seri-
ously affects the quality of life of patients.
The anti-diabetes activity of Rhizoma Coptidis was documented in the book “Notes of Elite 
Physicians” written by Hongjing Tao 1500 years ago [3, 4]. Berberine (BBR) is the major iso-
quinoline alkaloid constituent of the Chinese herb Rhizoma Coptidis [1,5,6,7], which has the 
beneficial characteristic of regulating glucose and lipid metabolism and has been extensively 
used in the treatment of obesity, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia [3]. Zucker diabetic fatty 
(ZDF) rats are an animal model of type 2 diabetes mellitus due to a leptin receptor gene muta-
tion. [8]. However, the exact anti-diabetic gene targets of berberine in diabetic model rats have 
not yet been fully elucidated.
Thus, in this study, we examined the hypoglycemic activity of berberine in ZDF rats and 
showed that berberine treatment changed the levels of gene expression in the liver to improve 
the diabetic metabolism. To identify the exact gene targets, we screened the genes, constructed 
a protein-protein interaction network, and validated the expression levels of the crucially dif-
ferentially expressed genes (DEGs) that were identified by protein-protein interaction network 
analysis using qRT-PCR.

Methods
Groups and treatment
Six-week-old male ZDF rats (housed two per cage) were obtained from the Animal Center of 
Zhejiang Chinese Medicine University. To induce diabetes symptoms, ZDFfa/fa rats were fed 
high-sugar/high-fat feed for 7 weeks, whereas ZDFfa/+ rats were fed the basic feed during this 
period. Afterward, the ZDFfa/fa rats were randomly divided into two groups that had a similar 
degree of hyperglycemia: the model group (DM) and the BBR group (n = 6 per group). The 
ZDFfa/+ rats served as the control (Con) group. The start and end of gavage, the mental and 
dietary status of animals were observed to monitor animal health in every day during the 
experimental procedure. The rats in the control and model groups were administered 0.5% 
gum tragacanth (CAS: 9000-65-1, Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. Shanghai, China) 
in normal saline via gavage, whereas the rats in the BBR group were administered berberine 
(K151212, Xi’an Kai Lai Biological Engineering Co., Ltd. Xi’an, China) at 300 mg/kg dissolved 
in 0.5% gum tragacanth in normal saline via gavage. All of the animals were housed at 25˚C 
with 50~70% humidity and a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle with free access to regular food and 
water. Before treatment, the first measurements (0 weeks) of the random plasma glucose, 
HbA1C, AST, ALT, BUN and CREA levels were taken. The random plasma glucose level was 
measured at the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 8th, 10th, and 12th weeks and the HbA1C, AST, ALT, BUN and 
CREA levels were measured at the 12th week. Throughout the experimental period, no animals 
died prior to the experimental endpoint. Blood samples were collected from heart after pento-
barbital sodium (45mg/kg, i.p.) anesthesia, and then rapidly excised liver tissues, which were 
quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80˚C for use in the microarray and quantita-
tive real-time PCR assays. At the end of the experiments, euthanasia occurred under sodium 
pentobarbital anesthesia followed by cardiac puncture/livers removal for all animals. This 
study was approved by the animal care and welfare committee of Zhejiang Chinese Medical 
University (permit number: ZSLL-20130-106). All of the procedures involving animals were 
performed under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia to minimize their suffering.
Measurement of Blood Biochemical Parameters
Random plasma glucose levels in ZDF rats after berberine administration. Sera were 
prepared from the blood collected at 0 weeks and at weeks 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, and 12 of the treatment 
via tail vein puncture. The random plasma glucose levels were measured using accu-chek1 
Performa (Roche Co., Ltd. Shanghai. China).
Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) in ZDF rats after berberine administration. Blood 
was collected at 0 weeks and at the 12th week of treatment via tail vein puncture. The levels of 
glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) were determined using a glycosylated hemoglobin analyzer 
(Quotient Diagnostics Ltd.).
AST, ALT, BUN and CREA levels in ZDF rats after berberine administration. Blood 
samples were obtained by puncturing retro-orbital plexus at 0 weeks and collected from heart 
under anesthesia at 12th week. The serum samples were obtained by centrifugation
(1000g × 10 min, 4˚C) for the measurement of blood biochemical parameters. AST, ALT, 
BUN and CREA levels were measured by a 7020 full automatic biochemical analyzer (Hitachi, 
Japan).
Glucose tolerance test. Upon completion of 12 h fasting, before the start as 0 weeks and 
end as 12th week of the study. Blood glucose was measured by withdrawing blood from tail 
vein. All rats received 2.5g/kg glucose by oral gavage, and blood glucose level was measured at 
four time points (0, 30, 60, 120 min after gavage). Respectively, the area under the curve of oral

glucose tolerance test (AUCOGTT) was measured through 1/4*(a+b)+1/4*(b+c)+1/2*(c+d), a,b, 
c,d stand for 0, 30, 60, and 120 min’s blood glucose level. The blood glucose level observed 
between 30, 60, and 120 min, among various groups compared to 0 min, was used for assessing 
glucose tolerance. The glucometer used was the accu-chek1 Performa (Roche Co., Ltd. Shang-
hai. China).
RNA preparation and microarray assay
The liver samples acquired from the control, DM, and BBR groups (n = 3 per group) were uti-
lized in a microarray assay. Agilent rat gene expression 4x44K microarrays, which cover 
approximately 26,930 genes, were chosen for this study. The total RNA was purified using a 
QIAGEN RNeasy Mini Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen, 217004).
The quantity of the total RNA in each sample was determined using a NanoDrop instrument, 
and the RNA integrity was assessed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 instrument (Agilent 
Technology, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The microarray assay was independently repeated in trip-
licate. After hybridization and washing, the microarray chips were scanned using a DNA chip 
scanner (Agilent Technologies). Feature Extraction software was used to determine the signal 
intensities.
GO term enrichment and pathway analysis
The Gene Ontology (GO) platform (http://www.geneontology.org) is a community-based bio-
informatics resource in which terms describing gene-product attributes are organized in three 
structured networks [9]. GO enrichment analysis was performed for the 91 genes with signifi-
cantly increased expression and the 63 genes with significantly decreased expression using the 
Gene Ontology database. We defined the significance of GO term enrichment for the DEGs 
according to the P-value, with a cut-off value of 0.05 [9]. We assessed the liver DEGs according 
to their association with the biological process, molecular function and cellular component 
categories.
The pathways corresponding to the DEGs were investigated using the KEGG Orthology 
Based Annotation System 2.0 database (http://kobas.cbi.pku.edu.cn/), which is the most recent 
version of KOBAS. The function of KOBAS is to identify the human diseases and significantly 
enriched pathways that correspond to a given set of genes. The significance and selection of 
the associated pathways was based on the P-value, with a cut-off value of 0.05 [9].
Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction
The Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) database (http://
string-db.org/) identifies the interactions of gene products, including not only the direct physi-
cal interactions of proteins but also their functional interactions. To evaluate the interactions 
among the DEGs, we uploaded these genes and drew a color-coded protein-protein interaction 
network graph. We then imported the PPI data in text format into the Cytoscape program 
(http://www.cytoscape.org/) to visualize the relationships and used its network analyzer plug-
in to analyze the PPI network.
Quantitative real-time PCR analysis
Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses were performed using SYBR Green to 
validate the microarray and PPI network data. Total RNA was isolated from the whole livers 
of rats (n = 6 per group) using the TaKaRa MiniBEST Universal RNA Extraction kit 
(TaKaRa, Clontech). The amount and quality of the total RNA were determined using

spectrophotometry at 260/280 nm (Thermo Scientific, USA). The RNA was reverse-transcribed 
using PrimerScriptTM RT Master Mix (Perfect Real Time). Previously published primers were 
used to amplify the RHOA, MAPK4, DOT1L, SETD2, ME3 and DLAT genes [10,11,12,13,14], 
and primers obtained from PrimerBank (https://pga.mgh.harvard.edu/primerbank/) were used 
to amplify the SGK494 gene (Table 1). GAPDH was used as the internal control. The RHOA, 
MAPK4, SGK494, DOT1L, SETD2, ME3 and DLAT amplification conditions were as follows: 
pre-denaturation at 95˚C for 30 sec, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95˚C for 5 sec and 
annealing at 60˚C for 30 sec. The dissolution curve conditions were 65˚C for 0.05 sec and 95˚C 
for 0.5 sec. The relative mRNA expression levels in the Con, DM and BBR groups were calcu-
lated using the comparative Ct method.
Statistical analysis
The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS17.0 software. The data presented are the 
mean values ± standard deviation (SD), with P<0.05 indicating a significant difference. The 
figures were produced using GraphPad Prism 5 software.
Results
Berberine decreased the random plasma glucose level of DM rats
The random plasma glucose level of the DM rats was significantly higher than that of the con-
trol rats at 0 weeks (P<0.01) and at the 1st week (P<0.01), 3rd week (P<0.01), 5th week 
(P<0.01), 8th week (P<0.01), 10th week (P<0.01), and 12th week of the experimental period
(P<0.01). The random plasma glucose level in the BBR group was significantly lower at the 
1st week (P<0.01), 3rd week (P<0.01), 5th week (P<0.01), 10th week (P<0.05), and 12th week 
(P<0.05) of treatment than the levels in the DM group (Fig 1).
Berberine reduced the glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) level of DM 
rats
At 0 weeks and at the 12th week of the experimental period, the HbA1C levels were higher in 
the DM group than in the control group (P<0.01) (Fig 2). The HbA1C level of the DM rats 
treated with BBR for 12 weeks was significantly reduced compared with that of the untreated 
DM rats (P<0.05) [6].

(Agilent Technologies). Quantile normalization and PCA analysis of the raw data (Fig 4A and 
Fig 4B) showed that our data were symmetrical and representative. Among the DEGs (S1
Table) detected using microarray analysis, 661 genes had differentially up-regulated expression 
and 546 genes had differentially down-regulated expression (S2 Table). The genes with log2 
(Con vs DM) 2: 1 and log2 (BBR vs DM) 2: 1 expression levels and the genes with log2 (Con vs
DM) :s -1 and log2 (BBR vs DM) :s -1 expression levels at P<0.05 were combined, leading to
the identification of 154 genes with significantly different expression levels in the livers of the 
BBR group. Of these genes, 91 had significantly increased expression levels and 63 had signifi-
cantly decreased expression levels (S3 Table).
GO enrichment and pathway analysis
Both up-regulated and down-regulated genes were observed in the liver samples of the ZDF 
rats. GO analysis revealed that the functions of these genes are related to many biological pro-
cesses that are important for the occurrence and development of diabetes, such as the processes 
in the cellular component organization or biogenesis, metabolic process, biological regulation 
and response to stimulus categories. The molecular functions associated with these genes 
include transporter activity, catalytic activity, enzyme regulator activity and antioxidant activ-
ity, and the cellular components corresponding to these genes include organelle, cell part, mac-
romolecular complex and extracellular region (Fig 5).
The main pathways for both the up-regulated genes and the down-regulated genes are the 
lysine degradation, glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis-chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate, thy-
roid hormone synthesis, hematopoietic cell lineage, and pyruvate metabolism pathways
(Table 3).
Interaction network construction and network analysis
We evaluated 154 DEGs using the STRING version 10.0 database to identify the interactions 
among their gene products; this analysis identified 145 proteins. Then, a PPI network was

constructed using Cytoscape software (Fig 6) to provide insight into the molecular mecha-
nisms underlying the actions of the DEGs in the liver However, the network contained many 
isolated nodes, which did not provide useful information [15]. Therefore, we deleted the DEGs 
corresponding to isolated nodes and pairs of linked nodes, including Ppm1b, Atp2c1, Sod3,

mum degree of connectivity of a node and 1 as the minimum. The average degree of connec-
tivity of the nodes in the network was 2.1. When the degree of connectivity of a node was 
much greater than average, the node was considered significantly more important than the 
other nodes and was called the central node. The central node of a PPI network is the core pro-
tein in the network. In this study, the nodes were analyzed using a network analyzer, with the 
degree of connectivity of a node set as 2: the mean value for all nodes to identify candidate 
therapeutic target genes. RHOA, MAPK4, Sgk494, Setd2 and DLAT were identified as such 
genes. Based on the results of the KEGG pathway and protein-protein network analyses, Dot1l 
and Me3 were also identified as candidate target genes.
The seven genes with significantly different expression levels in nine liver samples (three 
each from the Con, DM, and BBR groups) were used to generate a heat map based on hierar-
chical clustering analysis of the normalized microarray expression data. The liver samples 
were collected from randomly selected members of the control, DM, and BBR groups (Fig 7).
Validation of the microarray data using real-time qRT-PCR
The validity of the microarray-based identification of genes with significantly different expres-
sion in the liver was confirmed using qRT-PCR. This method identified seven genes with sig-
nificantly different expression. As shown in Fig 5, the expression levels of DOT1L, SGK494, 
ME3 and SETD2 were significantly higher in the BBR group than in the DM group (Fig 8A, 
Fig 8B, Fig 8C and Fig 8D), whereas the expression levels of MAPK4, DLAT and RHOA were 
significantly lower in the BBR group than in the DM group (Fig 8E, Fig 8F and Fig 8G). The
expression level of each of these seven DEGs was significantly different at P<0.05, demonstrat-
ing that the qRT-PCR results regarding the seven DEGs were consistent with the microarray 
results (Fig 8H).
Discussion
The results of our study showed that berberine treatment of ZDF rats, which exhibit significant 
hyperglycemia as well as insulin resistance, obesity and hyperlipidemia, significantly reduced 
their random plasma glucose and HbA1C levels. These results suggest that berberine exerts its

anti-diabetic effect in ZDF rats by moderating the diabetic metabolism. These results are simi-
lar to those obtained in previous studies [7,16,17,18,19]. The administered dosage (300mg/kg) 
of berberine was determined according to the equation used for the adult maximal dosage in 
the clinic [7].The toxicity effect of berberine was evaluated by assaying liver and kidney func-
tion markers, the aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), blood 
urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (CREA). Although the biochemical results showed no marked 
statistical differences, but we still observed a tendency, the hepatoprotective and renoprotec-
tive effect of berberine by regulating liver and kidney function markers under our experimen-
tal conditions. The pathogenesis and pathological features of diabetes are not yet clear, and the 
vast majority of researchers consider diabetes to be a multifactorial disease. GO analysis of the 
genes with differentially down-regulated and up-regulated expression in the BBR group indi-
cated that these genes were associated with the categories of metabolic process, cellular process 
(ontology: biological process), catalytic activity, binding (ontology: molecular functions), cell 
part, and organelle (ontology: cellular functions). Interestingly, in studying the long noncoding 
RNAs that were differentially expressed in sperm samples collected from diabetic and non-dia-
betic mice, Jiang [9] found that these RNAs were associated with the GO categories of meta-
bolic process, cell part, binding and catalytic activity. The results of the present study are 
consistent with these findings. KEGG pathway analysis revealed that some of the genes that 
were differentially expressed in the BBR group are involved in lysine degradation and pyruvate 
metabolism. Lysine acetylation is vital for metabolic pathway activity and may regulate the bal-
ance between energy storage and expenditure [20]. Pyruvate is a central biochemical node con-
necting amino acid, carbohydrate, and fatty acid metabolism [21]. We found that the 
expression levels of DOT1L and SETD2, which are involved in lysine degradation, were up-

regulated in the BBR group. In addition, the expression levels of two genes involved in pyru-
vate metabolism were significantly altered in the BBR group, with down-regulation of DLAT 
and up-regulation of ME3. Lysine and pyruvate both play important roles in glycometabolism. 
Consequently, the results of our study provide a basis for research on the pathogenic mecha-
nisms of diabetes at the molecular level.
The results of the PPI network and pathway analyses of the genes that were significantly dif-
ferentially expressed in the livers of the ZDF rats suggest that seven genes, RHOA, MAPK4, 
SGK494, DOT1L, SETD2, ME3 and DLAT, play important roles in diabetes and are candidate 
targets for diabetes treatment.
Ras homolog gene family, member A (RHOA) is an important member of the Rho small G 
protein superfamily, which regulates cytoskeletal architecture and interacts with the down-
stream critical target ROCK to affect cell shrinkage, proliferation, migration and adhesion.
The RHOA/ROCK signaling pathway plays critical roles in the heart, liver, lungs and kidneys 
[22]. Excessive activation of the RHOA/ROCK signaling pathway plays an important role in 
the development of the chronic complications of diabetes [23]. RHOA also involved in renal 
integrity in diabetic mice, and its inhibitors attenuate diabetic nephropathy in different models 
of diabetes [24]. RHOA/ROCK signaling activated by TGF-β to regulate Nox4 activity, which

might be associated with abnormalities in renal structure [25]. Berberine ameliorates the 
microvascular complications of diabetes, the renoprotective and anti-oxidative stress effect of 
BBR by inhibiting the activation of RHOA/ROCK signaling [26]. RHOA was significantly 
down-regulated in the BBR group in this study, which is consistent with these findings.
Mitogen-activated protein kinase 4 (MAPK4) is a protein serine/threonine kinase that spe-
cifically regulates the activity of mitogen-activated protein kinase. The MAPK-mediated

signaling pathway plays a major role in cell growth, proliferation, differentiation and apopto-
sis. In addition, this pathway is involved in insulin resistance and protein phosphorylation.
Up-regulated MAPK4 expression can lead to insulin resistance, and MAPK4 overexpression 
inhibits insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by negatively regulating the insulin signal-transduc-
tion pathway [27]. The ZDF rat diabetic model used in this study is a typical model of insulin 
resistance. The microarray and PCR results showed that the MAPK4 expression was signifi-
cantly increased in the DM group compared with the control group. In contrast, the MAPK4 
expression was significantly decreased in the BBR group compared with the DM group.
Uncharacterized serine/threonine-protein kinase (SGK494) is an important member of the 
AGC protein kinase family. AGC kinases not only are involved in diverse cellular functions 
but also may be associated with human diseases, such as diabetes, obesity, inflammation and 
viral infections [28,29]. To the best of our knowledge, no studies further elucidating the role of 
this kinase in diabetes have been conducted, and there are no reports of the effect of BBR treat-
ment on SGK494. Our study is the first to show the increased expression of SGK494 in BBR-
treated ZDF rats.
DOT1L, a nucleosomal histone 3 (H3)-specific methyltransferase, participates in a variety 
of cellular processes, including reprogramming, development, differentiation, and prolifera-
tion [30]. Zhou et al. found that DOT1L encodes histone H3K79 methyltransferase Dot1a, 
which contributes to the recovery of renal injury in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats [31]. 
DOT1L deficiency results in the upregulation of endothelin-1 (ET-1) expression at both 
mRNA and protein levels in diabetic kidney, and suggest that associated with decreased 
expression of Dot1a [31]. DOT1L also regulates water homeostasis, and identify AQP5 as a 
potential novel target of Dot1a, an AQP2 binging partner and regulator. Moreover, depletion 
of DOT1L led to endogenous AQP5 upregulation, but the upregulated AQP5 contribute to 
polyuria in patients with diabetic nephropathy, suggesting that DOT1L is critical in renal 
water homeostasis with DN [32]. In the current study, the PCR results showed higher expres-
sion of DOT1L in the BBR group than in the DM group, suggesting that the DOT1L is a poten-
tial target about the renoprotective effect of BBR.
SET domain-containing 2 (SETD2) is a histone methyltransferase that trimethylates lysine 
36 of H3 (H3K36) and is involved in transcriptional elongation, RNA processing, and DNA 
repair [33]. The H3K36 site can be modified by methylation, and its modified state is con-
trolled by the dynamic regulation of the methyl transferase and the demethylase that are spe-
cific to H3K36. Histone demethylation plays a role in the transcriptional regulation of 
gluconeogenesis, which has important implications for the treatment of diabetes [34].
Malic enzyme (ME) is a lipogenic enzyme whose activity level is correlated with the rate of 
fatty acid synthesis [13]. The mitochondrial NADP malic enzyme (ME3) is one isoform of ME. 
The function of mitochondrial MEs is to supply adequate amounts of pyruvate for the opera-
tion of the Krebs cycle [35], and their expression is synergistically regulated by insulin and glu-
cose [36]. Hasan et al. found that ME3 participates in the insulin secretion by pancreatic β-
cells, and knockdown of ME3 inhibited insulin release stimulated by glucose, pyruvate or
2- aminobicyclo [2,2,1] heptane-2-carboxylic acid-plus-glutamine, suggesting that ME3 far 
more than ME1 or ME2 is necessary for insulin release [37]. The knockdown of ME3 led to 
the inhibition of insulin release might cause by lowering its malic enzyme catalytic activity. In 
this study, we found that ME3 was expressed at a higher level in the BBR group than in the 
DM group might suggest that BBR improves insulin release through increase the expression of 
ME3 and its catalytic activity.
Dihydrolipoamide S-acetyltransferase (DLAT) is the E2 component of the large mitochon-
drial pyruvate dehydrogenase-containing complex that catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to 
acetyl coenzyme A [38], and a responsible gene for pyruvate dehydrogenase complex defect

causes of mitochondrial disorders [39]. Moreover, Goguet-Rubio et al revel a central role for 
DLAT in the pyruvate metabolism program regulated through E4 transcription factor 1 [40]. 
Lee et al. used cDNA microarray analysis to study the placental gene expression related to glu-
cose metabolism and found nine genes with altered expression levels, including DLAT, which 
related to the tricarboxylic acid cycle pathway. Through increased mRNA and protein expres-
sion of DLAT to increase glycolysis and gluconeogenesis [41]. In this study, we found that the 
DLAT expression was significantly down-regulated in the BBR-treated ZDF rats. Exact mecha-
nisms whereby BBR and DLAT interact and how this impacts on pyruvate metabolism warrant 
further investigation.
In this study, we did not focus on the DEGs represented as pairs of linked nodes in the PPI 
network. However, these genes may play roles in diabetes; one of these genes encodes Ppm1b 
(protein phosphatase, Mg2+/Mn2+ dependent, 1B, Ppm1b), which increases the expression of 
PPARγ. In adipocytes, PPARγ not only promotes the removal of lipids and free fatty acids 
(FFAs) but also inhibits the production of proinflammatory cytokines, ameliorating insulin 
resistance [42]; this finding suggests that Ppm1b and other genes may be worth further study 
under certain conditions. Therefore, we will investigate the simply linked genes in a follow-up 
study.
In conclusion, based on current experimental evidence, our study showed that BBR treat-
ment improved the glucose metabolism and has protective effects against hepatorenal 
impairment of diabetic rats. We found that the RHOA, MAPK4, SGK494, DOT1L, SETD2, 
ME3 and DLAT genes were significantly differentially expressed in the livers of the BBR and 
DM groups and thus are potential targets for the treatment of T2DM. These results provide 
molecular information that will facilitate elucidating the mechanisms through which berberine 
alleviates T2DM, and further studies are required to confirm the results of this study.
