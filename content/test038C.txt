THE DECLINE AND FALL his tears with thofe of the patriarch, and earneftly enquired, if no hopes of relief could be entertained from the Greek emperors of the Eaft. The patriarch expofed the vices and weaknefs of the fuccef- fors of Conftantine. " I will roufe," exclaimed the hermit, " the *' martial nations of Europe in your caufe ;" and Europe was obe- dient to the call of the hermit. The aftonifhed patriarch difmiifed him with epiftles of credit and complaint, and no fooner did he land at Bari, than Peter haftened to kifs the feet of the Roman pontiff". His ftature was fmall, his appearance contemptible ; but his eye was keen and lively ; and he poiTeiFed that vehemence of fpeech, which feldom fails to impart the perfuafion of the foul *. He was born of a gentleman's family (for we muft now adopt a modern idiom), and his military fervice was under the neighbouring counts of Boulogne, the heroes of the firft crufade. But he foon re- linquiihed the fword and the world ; and if it be true, that his wife, however noble, was aged and ugly, he might withdraw, with the lefs reludance, from her bed to a convent, and at length to an her- mitage. In this auftere folitude, his body was emaciated, his fancy was inflamed ; whatever he wiihed, he believed ; whatever he be- lieved, htfaw in dreams and revelations. From Jerufalem, the pil- grim returned an accompliihed fanatic ; but as he excelled in the popular madnefs of the times, pope Urban the fecond received him as a prophet, ayplauded his glorious defign, promifed to fupport it in a general council, and encouraged him to proclaim the deliverance of the Holy Land. Invigorated by the approbation of the pontiff",, his zealous miflionary traverfed, with fpeed and fuccefs, the provinces of Italy and France. His diet was abftemious, his prayers long and fervent, and the alms which he received with one hand, he diftrt- applied to the quarrelfome humour of perfona contcmptibilis, vivacis ingenii, et thofe ftudents, in tlie uiiiverfity of Paris, who occulum habens perfpicacem gratumque, et came from the frontier of France and Flan- fponte fluens ei non decrat eloquium.

He preached to innumerable crowds in the churches, the ftreets, and the highways : the hermit entered with equal confidence the palace and the cottage ; and the people, for all was people, was impetuoufly moved by his call to repentance and arms. When he painted the fuiFerings of the natives and pilgrims of Paleftine, every heart was melted to com- paffion ; every breaft glowed with indignation, when he challenged the warriors of the age to defend their brethren and refcue their Saviour : his ignorance of art and language was compenfated by fighs, and tears, and ejaculations ; and Peter fupplied the deficiency of reafon by loud and frequent appeals to Chrift and his Mother, to the faints and angels of paradife, with whom he had perfonally con- verfed. The moil perfedl orator of Athens might have envied the luccefs of his eloquence : the ruftic enthufiaft infpired the paflions which he felt, and Chriftendora expeded with impatience the coun- fels and decrees of the fupreme pontiff.

He attempted to unite the powers of the Weft, at a time when the princes were feparated from the church, and the people from their princes, by the excommunication which hlmfelf and his predeceffbrs had thundered againft the emperor and the king of France. Philip the firft,^ of France, fupported with patience the Genfures which he had provoked by his fcandalous life and adulte- rous marriage. Henry the fourth, of Germany, aiTerted the right of inveftltures, the prerogative of confirmmg his biihops by the de- livery of the ring and crofier.

In their fuppliant addrefs they flattered the pride of the Latin princes ; and, appealing at once to their policy and religion, ex- horted them to repel the Barbarians on the confines of Afia, rather than to expedl them in the heart of Europe. At the fad tale of the mifery and perils of their Eaftern brethren the aifembly burft into tears : the moft eager champions declared their readinefs to march ; and the Greek ambaiTadors were difmifled with the aiTurance of a fpeedy and powerful fuccour. The relief of Conftantinople was in- cluded in the larger and moft diftant project of the deliverance of Jerufalem ; but the prudent Urban adjourned the final decifion to a fecond fynod, which he propofed to celebrate in fome city of France in the autumn of the fame year. The fliort delay would propagate the flame of enthufiafm ; and his firmeft hope was in a nation of foldiers *, ftill proud of the pre-eminence of their name, and am- bitious to emulate their hero Charlemagne % who, in the popular romance of Turpin ", had atchieved the conqueft of the Holy Land.

In this narrow compafs, lie was poffeiTed of wealth and jurifdidion ; but in the reft of France, Hugh and his firft defendants were no more than the feudal lords of about fixty dukes and counts, of independent and hereditary power '% who difdained the control of laws and legal afi'emblies, and whofe difregard of their fovereign was revenged by the difobedience of their inferior vaflals. At Cler- mont, in the territories of the count of Auvergne ", the pope might brave with impunity the refentment of Philip ; and the council which he convened in that city was not lels numerous or refpedtable than the fynod of Placentia '*.

But a law, however venerable be the fanQion, cannot fuddenly transform the temper of the times ; and the benevolent efforts of Urban deferve the lefs praife, fince he laboured to appeafe fome domeftic quarrels that he might fpread the flames of war from the Atlantic to the Euphrates. From the fynod of Placentia, the rumour of his great defign had gone forth among the nations : the clergy on their return had preached in every diocefe the merit and glory of the deliverance of the Holy Land ; and when the pope afcended a lofty fcaffold in the market-place of Clermont, his eloquence was addreffed to a well prepared and impatient audience. His topics were obvious, his ex- hortation was vehement, his fuccefs inevitable.

The propofal was joyfully accepted j great numbers both of the clergy and laity impreifed on their garments the fign of the crofs '\ and folicited the pope to march at their head. This dangerous honour was declined by the more prudent fucceflbr of Gregory, who alleged the fchifm of the church, and the duties of his paftoral office, recommending to the faithful, who were difqualified by fex or profeffion, by age or infirmity, to aid, with their prayers and alms, the perfonal fervice of their robuft brethren. The name and powers of his legate he devolved on Adhemar biihop . of Puy, the firfl who had received the crofs at his hands. The fore- moft of the temporal chiefs was Raymond count of Thouloufe, whofe ambafladors in the council excufed the abfence, and pledged the honour, of their mafter. After the confeiTion and abfolution of their fins, the champions of the ciOfs were difmiiTed with a fuperfluous admonition to invite their countrymen and friends ; and their de- parture for the Holy Land was fixed to the feftival of the AiTumption, the fifteenth of Auguft, of the enfuing year".

' The policy of an action may be determined from the tardy leffbns of experi- ence ; but, before we a£t, our confcience flaould be iiuisfied of the juilice and propriety of our enterprife. In the age of the crufades, the Chriftians, both of the Eaft and Weft, were perfuaded of their lawfulnefs and merit ; their arguments are clouded by the perpetual abufe of fcripture and rhetoric ; but they feem to infift on the right of natural and religious defence, their peculiar title to the Holy Land, and the impiety of their Pagan and Mahometan foes". I. The right of a juft defence may fairly include our civil and ipi- ritual allies : it depends on the exlftence of danger ; and that danger muft be eftimated by the two-fold confideration of the malice, and the power, of our enemies. A pernicious tenet has been imputed to the Mahometans, the duty of exiirpati/tg all other religions by the fword. This charge of ignorance and bigotry is refuted by the Koran, by the hiftory of the Mufulman conquerors, and by their public and legal toleration of the Chriftian worihip. But it cannot be denied, that the Oriental churches are deprefled under their iron Thefaurarius de Acquifitione Terr^ Sanfts into the firil anonymous writer of Bongarfius.

In the eleventh century, the vidlorious arms of the Turks prefented a real and urgent apprehenfion of thefe lofles. They had fubduerf in lefs than thirty years the kingdoms of Afia, as far as Jerufalem and the Hellefpont ; and the Greek empire tottered on the verge of deilrudion. Befides an honeft fympathy for their bre- thren, the Latins had a right and intereft in the fupport of Conflan- tinople, the moil important barrier of the Weft ; and the privilege of defence muft reach to prevent, as Avell as to repel, an impending aflault. But this falutary purpofe might have been accompliflied by a moderate fucccur ; and our calmer reafon muft difclaim the innu- merable hofts and remote operations, v/hich overwhelmed Afia and depopulated Europe. II. Paleftine could add nothing to the ftrength or fafety of the Latins ; and fanaticifm alone could pretend to juftify the conqueft of that diftant and narrow province. The Chrlftians affirmed that their inalienable title to the promifed land had been fealed by the blood of their divine Saviour : it Vi^as their right and duty to refcue their inheritance from the unjuft pofleiTors, who pro- faned his fepulchre, and oppreiTed the pilgrimage of his difciples. Vainly would it be alleged that the pre-em.inence of Jerufalem, and the fan£lity of Paleftine, have been aboliihed with the Mofaic law; that the God of the Chriftians is not a local deity, and that the re- covery of Bethlem or Calvary, his cradle or his tomb, will not atone for the violation of the moral precepts of the gofpel. Such ar- guments glance afide from the leaden iliield of fuperftition ; and the religious mind will not eafily relinquiih its hold on the facred ground of myftery and miracle. III. But the lioly wars which have been waged in every climate of the globe, from Egypt to Livonia, and from Peru to Hindoftan, require the fupport of fome more general and flexible tenet.

Above four hundred years before the firft crufade, tlie eaftern and weftern provinces of the Roman empire had been ac- quired about the fame time, and in the fame manner, by the Barba- rians of Germany and Arabia. Time and treaties had legitimated the conquefts of the Chr'iflian Franks; but in the eyes of their fubjeds i and neighbours, the Mahometan princes were ftill tyrants and ufurpers, who, by the arms of war or rebellion, might be lawfully driven from their unlawful poiTefllon ". As the manners of the Chriftians were relaxed, their dlfcipline of Spiritual mo- tives and in- penance " was enforced ; and with the multiplication of fms, the duigences. remedies were multiplied. In the primitive church, a voluntary and open confeihon prepared the work of atonement. In the middle ages, the biihops and prieils interrogated the criminal ; compelled him to account for his thoughts, words, and ailions ; and prefcribed the terms of his reconciliation with God. But as this difcretionary power might alternately he abufed by indulgence and tyranny, a rule of difcipline was framed, to inform and regulate the fpiritual judges. This mode of legiCatlon was invented by the Greeks ; ύ\ύΐ penitentials'^^ were tranflated, or imitated, in the Latin church; and, in the time of Charlemagne, the clergy of every diocefe were provided with a code, which they prudently concealed from the knowledge of the vulgar.

But the rigid execution of thefe laws would have depopulated the palace, the camp, and the city : the Barbarians of the Weft believed and trembled ; but nature often rebelled againft principle ; and the magiftrate laboured without effeil to enforce the jurifdidtion of the prieft.

They oifered their blood to the Son of God, who had laid down his life for their falvation : they took up the crofs, and entered with confidence into the way of the Lord. His providence would ■vvatch over their fafety ; perhaps his viiiblc and miraculous power would fmooth the difficulties of their holy enterprife. The cloud and pillar of Jehovah had marched before the Ifraelltes Into the pro- mifed land. Might not the Chriftians more reafonably hope that the rivers would open for their pafTige ; that the walls of the ilrongeil cities would fall at the found of their trumpets ; and that the fun would be arrefied in his mid-career, to allow them time for the de- ftruiilion of the infidels ? Temporal Of the chlcfs and foldiers who marched to the holy fepulchre, I Λνϊΐΐ dare to affirm, that all were prompted by the fpirit of enthufiafm ; the belief of merit, the hope of reward, and the affiirance of divine aid.
