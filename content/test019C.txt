We report an updated stochastic model of cerebellar Long Term Depression (LTD) 
with improved realism. Firstly, we verify experimentally that dissociation of Raf kinase 
inhibitor protein (RKIP) from Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) is required 
for cerebellar LTD and add this interaction to an earlier published model, along with 
the known requirement of dissociation of RKIP from Raf kinase. We update Ca2 
dynamics as a constant-rate inﬂux, which captures experimental input proﬁles accurately. 
We improve α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4 isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor 
interactions by adding phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of AMPA receptors when 
bound to glutamate receptor interacting protein (GRIP). The updated model is tuned to 
reproduce experimental Ca2 peak vs. LTD amplitude curves at four different Ca2 pulse 
durations as closely as possible. We ﬁnd that the updated model is generally more robust 
with these changes, yet we still observe some sensitivity of LTD induction to copy number 
of the key signaling molecule Protein kinase C (PKC). We predict natural variability in this 
number by stochastic diffusion may inﬂuence the probabilistic LTD response to Ca2 
input in Purkinje cell spines and propose this as an extra source of stochasticity that may 
be important also in other signaling systems.

INTRODUCTION 
Cerebellar long-term depression (LTD) is a decrease in the eﬃcacy of synaptic transmission 
from parallel ﬁbers (PFs) to Purkinje cells (PCs) (Ito, 2001). A transient increase in postsynaptic 
Ca2 concentration is crucial for the induction of LTD, leading to activation of many molecular 
species that are implicated in synaptic plasticity (Tanaka and Augustine, 2008; Figure 1). The 
molecular processes result in phosphorylation of AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) by 
Ca2 -dependent protein kinase C (PKC) and their subsequent removal from the surface of the PF- 
PC synapse (Ito, 2001; Evans, 2007; Gallimore et al., 2016). Based on experimental evidence, the 
mechanism that is responsible for maintaining PKC activation after the Ca2 stimulus has ﬁnished 
is a Ca2 -activated positive feedback loop involving a speciﬁc mitogen-activated protein kinase, 
the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK; Bhalla and Iyengar, 1999; Tanaka and Augustine, 
2008; Antunes and De Schutter, 2012). In this pathway, PKC activation leads to activation of 
Raf by a process that involves phosphorylation of RKIP (Yamamoto et al., 2012). Raf activates 
Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK), which activates ERK. Activated ERK then activates

LTD Model Including RKIP 
FIGURE 1 | The Cerebellar Long Term Depression molecular network in LTD_STEPS 2.1. The phosphorylation and dephosphorylation pathways in our model. 
This network is activated by increase in intracellular Ca2 and the model has been tuned to Ca2 uncaging experiments. Numbers in brackets give the initial number 
of molecules in the spine for each simulation and correspond to the estimated number of molecules located in one spine of a Purkinje cell dendrite of volume 0.08 
µm3 where a concentration of 1 µM corresponds to 48 molecules. PKC phosphorylates AMPAR and is responsible for its reduction from the surface leading 
eventually to LTD. Our model includes a MAPkinase feedback loop, which involves Raf, MEK, ERK, cPLA2 and AA molecules. Transiently activated by Ca2 initially, 
PKC activity is maintained by this feedback loop. PP2A dephosphorylates AMPAR, thus counteracting PKC activity on AMPAR, and also suppresses feedback loop 
activity. Raf regulation has been improved by the addition of the RKIP mechanism in the current version of the model, and MEK-RKIP interaction has also been 
included. This scheme was illustrated using the Motifolio PPT Drawing Toolkits (Motifolio Inc, MD, USA). 
cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), which produces 
arachidonic acid (AA), which activates PKC (O’Flaherty 
et al., 2001) completing the loop. Within the network, Protein 
phosphatase 2 (PP2A) plays a duel role; it dephosphorylates 
MEK (Sontag et al., 1993) suppressing feedback loop activity, and 
dephosphorylates AMPARs (Launey et al., 2004) counteracting 
AMPAR internalization. Due to the small size of PC dendritic 
spines, stochastic simulation of the network is necessary and an 
initial stochastic model predicted that single synapses exist in one 
of two discrete stable states—LTD or non-LTD—with no clear 
threshold of response to the input Ca2 signal (Antunes and 
De Schutter, 2012); features which are absent with deterministic 
modeling. 
In this study we present an update to the 2012 stochastic 
LTD model (Antunes and De Schutter, 2012) with several 
new components. For convenience, we term the 2012 model 
“LTD_STEPS 1.0” and the updated models presented in 
this paper “LTD_STEPS 2.0” and “LTD_STEPS 2.1.” Recent 
experiment evidence shows the role of Raf kinase inhibitor 
protein (RKIP) in regulating Raf (Corbit et al., 2003; Yamamoto 
et al., 2012). RKIP binds to Raf-1 making an RKIP-Raf complex 
(Figure 1). Activation of PKC by a transient increase in Ca2 
leads to phosphorylation of RKIP bound to Raf, which results 
in release of Raf from the complex. Based on this evidence 
we improve LTD_STEPS 1.0 by adding more realistic reactions 
contributing to Raf activation. It’s important to note at this 
point that in our model we do not distinguish between the 
three distinct Raf isoforms: Raf-1 (or c-Raf), B-Raf and A-Raf 
(Matallanas et al., 2011). There is evidence for expression of 
at least two diﬀerent isoforms in Purkinje cells, Raf-1, and B- 
Raf, and with diﬀerence subcellular locations (Morice et al., 
1999). In our previous work we saw clear expression of Raf-1 
in Purkinje cell dendrites (Yamamoto et al., 2012) and, based 
on these observations, we have largely focused on Raf-1 speciﬁc 
interactions when developing the LTD model. However, earlier 
reports have suggested B-Raf is also expressed in Purkinje cell 
dendrites (Morice et al., 1999), so we cannot rule out some 
role of B-Raf within the pathway. However, Raf-1 and B-Raf 
perform similar functions, both binding and phosphorylating 
MEK, although with diﬀerent kinetics (Matallanas et al., 2011). 
RKIP is known to associate with both Raf-1 and B-Raf isoforms 
(Trakul et al., 2005) and has been shown to inhibit B-Raf 
activation in cancer cells (Park et al., 2005) as well as the 
strong interaction with Raf-1 previously mentioned. So due 
to the similar role for Raf-1 and B-Raf within the pathway, 
including activation of MEK and interaction with RKIP, and lack 
of conclusive experimental evidence for more detailed modeling, 
our approach is to include a generic Raf molecule in the feedback 
loop with overall activity tuned to match experimental data, and 
not to incorporate isoform-speciﬁc kinetics.

Hepburn et al. 
LTD Model Including RKIP 
In addition to its interaction with Raf, RKIP has been reported 
to interfere with Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) 
phosphorylation by forming ternary complexes with MEK, 
resulting in the suppression of feedback loop activation (Yeung 
et al., 2000). To understand this signiﬁcance in the context 
of cerebellar LTD we also investigate experimentally whether 
dissociation of RKIP from MEK is required for PKC activation of 
the ERK pathway, and make further improvements to our model 
based on these ﬁndings. We also improve the Ca2 dynamics and 
adjust several parameters so that both the Ca2 input signal and 
response of the model mimic experimental observations closely. 
We compare LTD_STEPS 2.1 to LTD_STEPS 2.0 and 
LTD_STEPS 1.0 in terms of noise propagation and sensitivity, 
concluding that LTD_STEPS 2.1 appears to be generally more 
robust, yet with no adverse aﬀect on LTD induction. As an initial 
practical application of LTD_STEPS 2.1, we test the inﬂuence 
of cytoplasmic PKC copy number—which may vary naturally 
within spines by eﬀects such as stochastic diﬀusion and varying 
spine morphology—on LTD induction. Diﬀering LTD induction 
probabilities are observed within the estimated natural range of 
cytoplasmic PKC, and we propose that dynamic variability in 
signaling molecules may act as an extra signiﬁcant source of 
stochasticity in synaptic signaling pathways. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Experimental Procedures 
All procedures involving mice were carried out in accordance 
with the recommendations of the Institutional Animal Care and 
Use Committee of Korea Institute of Science and Technology. 
The protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and 
Use Committee of Korea Institute of Science and Technology. 
Cloning Experiments 
Recombinant glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and GST-fused 
mutant of Raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP-TV-delRBD) were 
puriﬁed from E. coli using glutathione sepharose (Amersham 
Biosciences). RKIP-TV-delRBD possesses a single mutation of 
threonine residue 153 to valine (Corbit et al., 2003) and a deletion 
mutation of amino acids 77–108, which include a main site for its 
association with Raf-1 (Yeung et al., 2000). Puriﬁed proteins were 
dialyzed in HEPES buﬀered solution (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.2), 
concentrated by centrifugal ﬁlter devices (Millipore), and stored 
at −80◦C. 
Electrophysiology Experiments 
Chemicals were obtained from Sigma or Wako Pure Chemical 
Industries, unless otherwise speciﬁed. Whole-cell patch clamp 
recordings were made from Purkinje cells in sagittal slices 
(200 µm) of cerebella from 17- to 21-day-old mice of either sex. 
Slices were bathed in extracellular solution (ACSF) containing 
(in mM): 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.3 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 1.25 
NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, 20 glucose, and 0.01 bicuculline 
methochloride (Tocris). Patch pipettes (resistance 5–6 M ) 
were ﬁlled with (in mM): 130 potassium gluconate, 2 NaCl, 
4 MgCl2 , 4 Na2-ATP, 0.4 Na-GTP, 20 HEPES (pH 7.2), 10 
phosphocreatine and 0.25 EGTA. Recombinant proteins (1– 
2 mg/ml) were added into the internal solution along with 
dextran-conjugated ﬂuorescein (Molecular Probes), to monitor 
the dialysis of intracellular solutions into Purkinje cells by a 
ﬂuorescent microscope (Olympus BX61WI or Nikon Eclipse 
FN1). Excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were evoked 
in Purkinje cells (holding potential of −70 mV) by activating 
parallel ﬁbers (PFs) with a glass-stimulating electrode on the 
surface of the molecular layer (PF-EPSCs). PF-EPSCs were 
acquired and analyzed using pClamp software (Molecular 
Devices). To evoke LTD by electrical stimulation (PF& V), PF 
stimuli were paired with Purkinje cell depolarization ( 10 mV, 
200 ms) 300 times at 1 Hz. Data were accepted if the series 
resistance changed <20%, input resistance was >80 M , and 
holding current changed <10%. 
Statistical diﬀerences were determined by the Student’s t-test 
and analysis was performed with OriginPro 8.1 software. 
Immunoblotting Experiments 
The inhibitory eﬀect of RKIP-TV-delRBD on ERK 
phosphorylation was tested by immunoblotting, as described 
previously (Yamamoto et al., 2012). In brief, human embryonic 
kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells transfected with pEGFP-RKIP- 
WT or pEGFP-RKIP-TV-delRBD were treated with or without 
TPA (100 nM) for 5 min and lysed in lysis buﬀer containing 
the following: 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 8, 1 mM EDTA, 
0.2% NP-40 alternative (Calbiochem), 10% glycerol, 1X 
proteinase inhibitor cocktail, and 1X phosphatase inhibitor 
cocktail. The supernatants of cell lysates were subjected to 
SDS-PAGE analysis to detect phosphorylated ERK, ERK, and 
GFP by immunoblotting. Primary antibodies used were rabbit 
anti-ERK (Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-phospho- 
ERK (Cell Signaling Technology) or mouse anti-GFP (Roche 
Applied Science). Secondary antibodies used were horseradish 
peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (GE 
Healthcare) antibodies. 
Addition of RKIP Reactions to LTD_STEPS 
1.0 
Due to lack of experimental evidence on speciﬁc mechanisms 
for Raf activation LTD_STEPS 1.0 contained an artiﬁcial Raf 
activation reaction (Antunes and De Schutter, 2012). Raf-Act 
molecule became activated by PKC, and then activated Raf. 
Recently, a role of RKIP in regulating Raf activation during 
cerebellar LTD has been proposed experimentally (Corbit et al., 
2003; Yamamoto et al., 2012). According to these experimental 
results in Purkinje cells, RKIP inhibits the Raf activation of MEK 
by making complexes with Raf. Experimental characterization 
using high-resolution heteronuclear nuclear magnetic resonance 
spectroscopy (Odabaei et al., 2004) demonstrated that Raf-RKIP 
interaction is regulated mainly by the phosphorylation of RKIP 
at Ser-153. RKIP binds to Raf in the native form and when 
phosphorylated releases Raf. The Raf released from the complex 
may or may not be active. Experimental evidence suggests 
that PKC phosphorylates RKIP and dissociates the RKIP-Raf 
complex, usually releasing active Raf (Corbit et al., 2003).

Hepburn et al. 
LTD Model Including RKIP 
To obtain the Raf-RKIP binding kinetic parameters, we 
analyzed a published mathematical model that explores the 
kinetic parameters for Raf-RKIP complex formation (Kwang- 
Hyun et al., 2003). This model includes a reaction in which 
artiﬁcial molecule RKIP phosphatase (RP) dephosphorylates 
phosphorylated RKIP. This model is also based on the old 
theory of Raf-RKIP complex dissociated by ERK, which is now 
generally refuted since the evidence of phosphorylation was 
based on the wrong pocket-binding site of RKIP previously 
established. Initially we replicated this model in STEPS and 
validated the implementation. We then modiﬁed this isolated 
model by removing the ERK phosphorylation reaction on 
RKIP. We added a cPLA2-AA-PKC loop to this isolated model, 
where ERK phosphorylates cPLA2, which activates PKC via AA 
(Supplementary Figure 1). In our new isolated model of the loop, 
PKC dissociates the Raf-RKIP reaction, with phosphorylation 
kinetics as that of ERK in the model. The artiﬁcial RP reaction was 
retained in this modiﬁed isolated model due to no experimental 
results for alternative RKIP dephosphorylation (although some 
studies suggests a fast de-phosphorylation of RKIP; Lorenz et al., 
2003). 
We added the isolated model to LTD_STEPS 1.0 and termed 
the new model LTD_STEPS 2.0. RKIP also forms complexes 
with MEK (Yeung et al., 2000) and thus we added the RKIP- 
MEK complex to LTD_STEPS 2.0. We used the same parameters 
for RKIP-MEK complex as for RKIP-Raf reactions. In our 
model and with the experimental evidence shown in Section 
Dissociation of RKIP from Raf and MEK is Required for 
Cerebellar LTD, the dissociation of both the complexes is by 
activated PKC. In LTD_STEPS 2.0, activated PKC transfers to 
the membrane. The dissociation of Raf-RKIP complex by active 
PKC is a surface reaction and then the phosphorylated Raf 
and phosphorylated RKIP are transported into the cytoplasm 
again for further activities. We increased the Raf concentration 
to 0.15 µM (up from 0.10 µM in LTD_STEPS 1.0) based on 
recent experimental measurements of its average concentration 
(Fujioka et al., 2006). In cell populations the RKIP concentration 
is known to be around 5–10 times higher than Raf (Corbit 
et al., 2003). In LTD_STEPS 2.0, we used a RKIP concentration 
of 1.0 µM. 
We then added the interactions of PKC and PP2A 
with glutamate receptor interacting protein (GRIP)-bound 
AMPAR (GRIP_AMPAR) to the model, as described in Section 
Addition of PKC-GRIP_AMPAR and PP2A-GRIP_AMPAR 
Interactions Makes the Model More Robust and Reduces 
Fluctuations of ERK and cPLA2, and termed this model 
LTD_STEPS 2.1, so that the only diﬀerence in terms of 
molecular interactions between LTD_STEPS 2.0 and LTD_STEPS 
2.1 is the inclusion of the GRIP_AMPAR interactions in 
LTD_STEPS 2.1. LTD_STEPS 2.1 was then tuned by making 
small modiﬁcations to capture dose-response curves accurately 
compared to experimental data, as described in Section Updated 
Ca2 Dynamics Captures Experimental Input Ca2 Proﬁle 
and LTD Dose-Response Accurately. Apart from these changes 
mentioned, other binding parameters and concentrations were 
maintained from LTD_STEPS 1.0 (Antunes and De Schutter, 
2012). 
Simulations 
All simulations were run in software STEPS (Hepburn et al., 
2012). The LTD models were run as stochastic well-mixed 
models. 
Where computing the mean response of the bistable LTD 
model (such as for data shown in Figures 4, 5) 200 iterations 
of the model were run with diﬀerent random number seeds, and 
mean calculated over those 200 iterations. The LTD response was 
measured as the proportion of synaptic AMPARs 50 min after 
Ca2 stimulus relative to before stimulus. 
The diﬀusion simulation of Figure 7 was run on a tetrahedral 
mesh describing the dendritic morphology. This mesh consisted 
of a section of dendrite 20 µm length and diameter 1 µm 
with 20 spines of varying morphological properties (varying 
head volume, varying neck widths, and varying neck lengths) 
constrained by experimental observations (Harris and Stevens, 
1988). The simulations were run for 1000 s and population of 
PKC molecules recorded in all spine heads every 0.01 s. 
RESULTS 
Dissociation of RKIP from Raf and MEK Is 
Required for Cerebellar LTD 
Recent experiment evidence shows the role of Raf kinase 
inhibitor protein (RKIP) in regulating Raf (Corbit et al., 2003; 
Yamamoto et al., 2012). While RKIP interacts with and inhibits 
Raf, PKC-dependent phosphorylation of RKIP at serine or 
threonine 153 causes dissociation of RKIP from Raf, allowing 
Raf to activate downstream kinases MEK and ERK, so that the 
main pathway of PKC activating ERK is thought to be mediated 
by the dissociation of RKIP from Raf (Corbit et al., 2003; Lorenz 
et al., 2003; Figure 1). However, because RKIP was also shown to 
directly interact with MEK (Yeung et al., 2000), the dissociation 
of RKIP from MEK seems to be also required for the pathway 
of PKC activating ERK. Our previous study demonstrated that 
while a non-phosphorylatable RKIP mutant (RKIP-TV) inhibited 
cerebellar LTD, deletion of the binding site for both Raf and 
MEK in RKIP-TV reversed this eﬀect (Yamamoto et al., 2012). 
Biochemical analysis revealed the dissociation of RKIP from 
both Raf and MEK after LTD stimulation (Yamamoto et al., 
2012). These results suggest that the dissociation of RKIP from 
not only Raf, but also MEK, following RKIP phosphorylation 
is required for LTD. In the current study, we conﬁrmed the 
requirement of dissociation of RKIP from MEK for LTD by 
using another deletion mutant of non-phosphorylatable RKIP 
(RKIP-TV-delRBD), which lacks a main site for its association 
with Raf, yet includes a site binding with MEK (Yeung et al., 
2000). The immunoblot analysis in HEK293T cells demonstrated 
that RKIP-TV-delRBD inhibited ERK phosphorylation triggered 
by TPA, a PKC activator (Figure 2A), conﬁrming that RKIP- 
TV-delRBD interrupts ERK activation presumably through 
constitutive MEK binding. When control protein, GST, was 
introduced into Purkinje cells, the pairing electrical stimulation 
induced LTD (Figure 2B). On average, PF-EPSCs were depressed 
by 32.9 ± 5.2% (n 4) at 20–40 min after the end of PF& V. 
In contrast, introducing RKIP-TV-delRBD into Purkinje cells

± 8.7%; n 5; p < 0.01) than that in the presence of GST 
(Figure 2B). Because RKIP-TV-delRBD can be considered to 
interact with only MEK, this result supports that dissociation 
of RKIP from MEK following RKIP phosphorylation is also 
required for LTD. 
Updated Ca2 Dynamics Captures 
Experimental Input Ca2 Proﬁle and LTD 
Dose-Response Accurately 
LTD_STEPS 1.0 simulated changes in Ca2 concentration due to 
Ca2 uncaging with Gaussian-shaped Ca2 stimuli of durations 
from 1 to 60 s (Antunes and De Schutter, 2012). We obtained 
Ca2 concentration measurements of the original experimental 
Ca2 pulses with durations of 0.5, 1, 15, and 30 s (Tanaka et al., 
2007) and observed that they are skewed (Figure 3). Therefore, 
we ﬁtted a constant-rate response to mimic the experimental 
Ca2 uncaging dynamics more closely in LTD_STEPS 2.1 
(Figure 3). The constant-rate response was modeled as a simple 
production reaction for the duration of the pulse: 
k 
→[Ca2 ] 
where diﬀerent rates, k, give varying peaks of the Ca pulse. 
The experimentally measured degree of LTD induced by Ca2 
pulses of diﬀerent amplitudes follows a sigmoidal relationship 
(Tanaka et al., 2007): 
LTD LTDmax [Ca2 ]nHill

(1) 
We reﬁtted the output of the LTD_STEPS 2.1 model to the 
measurements of the original experimental data (Tanaka et al., 
2007). We reduced the number of AMPARs at rest in the 
synapse to 80 (Masugi-Tokita et al., 2007). LTD magnitude was 
measured 30 min after input for diﬀerent concentrations and 
pulse widths of Ca2 . Sigmoidal curves were obtained by the 
FIGURE 3 | Comparison between the measured Ca2 response to the 
constant rate Ca2 pulse in LTD_STEPS 2.1 (green) and Gaussian Ca2 
pulse in LTD_STEPS 1.0 (blue) to experimental data (black) for a 30 s 
Ca2 uncaging stimulus. The simulated pulses have the same peak value 
as the uncaging stimulus. 
Scipy optimize curve_ﬁt function for both the simulation data 
and experimental data. The parameters of the curves ([Hill 
coeﬃcient (nHill), the [Ca2 ] required to achieve the half- 
maximum magnitude of LTD (K1 2), and maximum depression 
(LTDmax)]) were measured from the optimized ﬁts, and the 
model ﬁne-tuned for best agreement between experimental 
observations and model behavior. The number of SERCA pumps 
in the model was reduced from LTD_STEPS 1.0 and the initial 
number of PKC and PP2A molecules adjusted to get the optimal 
ﬁts. PKC was adjusted to 1.1 µM (55 molecules) from 1 µM 
in LTD_STEPS 1.0 and PP2A was reduced to 0.7 µM (35 
molecules) from 1.5 µM. With these adjustments, the updated 
model shows realistic behavior quantitatively when compared 
to experimental measurements, with a perfect ﬁt of nHill and a

dephosphorylation by PP2A of synaptic AMPAR when bound 
to GRIP, only the small fraction of free AMPARs in the 
synapse could react with PKC and PP2A. The phosphorylation 
interactions with AMPAR bound to GRIP (GRIP_AMPAR) were 
added to the model LTD_STEPS 2.1 and the new behavior 
of this model compared to a version (LTD_STEPS 2.0) where 
these phosphorylation interactions are absent, but includes the 
addition of RKIP. Our ﬁrst observation was that with the 
GRIP_AMPAR interactions the model appears more robust. 
This is demonstrated by ultrasensitivity of LTD induction to 
Raf copy number in LTD_STEPS 2.0, resulting in a lack of 
stable LTD induction when the number of Raf molecules 
was below 5 (5 was the number of Raf molecules in the 
LTD_STEPS 1.0 model; Figure 5). Such strong sensitivity to Raf 
copy number was not observed in the more robust model LTD_ 
STEPS 2.1. 
With this change and other additions to the model, we 
tested one of the predictions of LTD_STEPS 1.0: strong 
ﬂuctuations of activation of molecules in the positive feedback 
loop, in particular of ERK and the cPLA2, were suggested 
as important indicators of activity in the feedback loop

shown in (C) and (D) the Ca2 input was longer in duration than for (A) and (B) at 15 s to give no expected failed runs of LTD (see Figure 4), so the CV 
measurements do not include any non-LTD traces.

LTD Model Including RKIP 
(Antunes and De Schutter, 2012). However, with the addition 
of RKIP and its interactions with Raf and MEK, plus 
the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of GRIP-bound 
AMPAR (model LTD_STEPS 2.1), the ﬂuctuations of these 
molecules was severely diminished (Figures 6A,C) compared to 
the 2012 report (see Figures 4,5 of Antunes and De Schutter, 
2012) and to the case where the interactions with GRIP- 
bound AMPAR are not included (model LTD_STEPS 2.0; 
Figures 6B,D). The loss of these ﬂuctuations did not aﬀect 
activity of the feedback loop, nor hinder induction of LTD 
(Figure 4). 
Stochastic Diffusion from Dendrite Causes 
Varying Molecule Population in Spines 
Dendritic spines cannot typically be thought of as isolated 
chemical compartments at relatively long timescales 
(Svoboda et al., 1996; Bloodgood and Sabatini, 2005), 
meaning that the inactive proteins that make up the initial 
state of the cytosolic signaling system may diﬀuse to and 
from the dendrite with the degree of dendritic coupling 
depending strongly on spine morphology (Bloodgood 
and Sabatini, 2005; Grunditz et al., 2008; Khan et al., 
2012). 
We constructed a diﬀusion model in realistic dendritic 
morphology to investigate how stochastic diﬀusion between 
dendrite and spine may aﬀect the initial presence of cytosolic 
proteins in a spine before stimulus. We injected cytoplasmic 
PKC molecules at a concentration of 1.14 µM, the concentration 
used in LTD_STEPS 2.1 before LTD induction, and simulated 
diﬀusion with a rate of 5.45 µm2s−1 (Craske et al., 2005). 
Figure 7A shows the normalized distribution of the number of 
PKC molecules in a spine of volume 0.08 µm3 from simulation 
compared to the binomial distribution. Figure 7B compares 
the resulting measured coeﬃcient of variation (CV) for all 
spines compared to the binomial distribution. As expected 
these results show that the binomial distribution is the correct 
description of expected molecule population per spine and so 
other morphological features play no important role on this 
long timescale. The relatively high CVs for these small volumes 
predicts a signiﬁcant natural variability in molecule number per 
spine. 
PKC Copy Number Affects Probability of 
LTD Induction 
The results of Figure 7A demonstrates that PKC copy number, 
with a mean of 55, has a signiﬁcant probability of being as 
low as ∼40 and as high as ∼70 by natural variation. We tested 
LTD_STEPS 2.1 under these two scenarios to investigate whether 
this range of variability in copy number could inﬂuence LTD 
induction. 
Figure 8B shows the response of the model under normal 
conditions, i.e., with initial PKC copy number of 55, where the 
probabilistic bistable behavior already observed in LTD_STEPS 
1.0 can clearly be seen. At 0 µM.s integrated Ca2 input, 
all runs of the model respond by ﬂuctuating around 0% 
LTD response, which we deﬁne as a non-LTD response 
FIGURE 7 | Free PKC stochastic diffusion simulated in tetrahedral 
mesh representing a section of Purkinje cell dendrite 20 µm length 
containing 20 spines of varying morphological properties. Simulation 
was run for 1000 s with PKC population sampled in each spine head every 
0.01 s. (A) For one spine of volume 0.08 µm3 normalized measured 
distribution of molecules over the 1000 s sample time (blue bars) compared to

corresponding to a physiological absence of spontaneous LTD. 
As integrated Ca2 increases, some runs switch to the other 
bistable state, that of ∼30% reduction in synaptic AMPARs, 
which we deﬁne as an LTD response. At some point (marked 
on the Figure with vertical dashed line) any individual run 
of the stochastic model has an equal probability of going 
to LTD or non-LTD, which is at ∼6 µM.s integrated Ca2 
with normal PKC copy number (Figure 8B). As Ca2 input 
increases further eventually all simulations give an LTD 
response. 
Figures 8A,C show that varying PKC copy number shifted 
the probabilistic threshold for LTD induction: for 40 molecules 
of PKC (Figure 8A) the position of equal LTD or non- 
LTD induction was at integrated Ca2 ∼9 µM.s, whereas it 
was at integrated Ca2 ∼4 µM.s for 70 molecules of PKC 
(Figure 8C). Based on these results we predict that variation in 
cytoplasmic PKC copy number, which occurs by the diﬀusion 
of molecules within dendrite and spines (Figure 7A), may 
signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the probability of LTD induction within 
a spine. We did not observe any other signiﬁcant eﬀect for

LTD Model Including RKIP 
FIGURE 8 | LTD response heatmaps of LTD_STEPS 2.1 with varying 
initial PKC copy number of (A) 40 molecules, (B) 55 molecules, and (C) 70 
molecules. Ca2 input to the model (e.g., Figure 3) is integrated for many 
different pulse durations and amplitudes and for the corresponding individual

heatmaps. The vertical dashed white lines indicate the approximate position 
where 50% of the simulations can be classiﬁed as non-LTD responses

varying PKC number in this range, such as a change in LTD 
amplitude. 
DISCUSSION 
We report an updated stochastic model of molecular LTD 
in parallel ﬁber-Purkinje cell synapses. The model is more 
realistic than LTD_STEPS 1.0 in terms of containing several 
new additions that are known to inﬂuence LTD induction and 
by more closely following experimental observations. We have 
shown experimentally that RKIP dissociation from MEK is 
necessary for LTD induction and we have added this interaction 
to the model as well as the known interactions of RKIP with 
Raf. The addition of PP2A and PKC interactions with AMPAR 
bound to GRIP appears to have increased the robustness of the 
model and reduced ﬂuctuations of ERK and cPLA2 without, 
however, adversely aﬀecting LTD induction. Adjustments to the 
Ca2 input and output dynamics both improve Ca2 proﬁles 
and capture LTD response curves accurately when compared to 
experiment. 
When considering the initial state of the LTD system, the 
molecular population can be expected to show natural variation 
described by the binomial distribution. The binomial distribution 
is one of the most commonly applied probability distributions in 
biology and in recent years has found increasing use in cellular 
biology such as for controlling the probabilistic distribution and 
open probability of membrane channels (Hille, 2001) including 
those on single spines (Sabatini and Svoboda, 2000; Ribrault 
et al., 2011), molecular ﬂuctuations in cell division (Kar et al., 
2009), and it also has very wide use in genetics, but it has 
not up to now (to our knowledge) been applied speciﬁcally 
to describe intracellular signaling molecule populations within 
small subcellular volumes such as dendritic spines. In this 
study we ﬁnd that this natural source of variability may 
signiﬁcantly aﬀect the probability of LTD induction. Speciﬁcally, 
we tested variation in PKC copy number, which was found 
to shift the LTD-Ca2 response curves. We did not model 
dynamic changes in PKC copy number after stimulus for 
these simulations, which is no doubt a simpliﬁcation but with 
some justiﬁcation since it has been proposed that spines act 
dynamically to restrict diﬀusion through the neck after stimulus 
in order to retain second messengers and activated proteins 
in the spines (Bloodgood and Sabatini, 2005), although the 
degree of compartmentalization depends on the time course 
of inactivation (Harvey et al., 2008). Signaling systems can be 
expected to be more robust to the variability in some signaling 
molecules than others, however, based on our ﬁndings we expect 
generally the response of molecular signaling systems to have 
some sensitivity to the natural variability in copy numbers 
and propose this as an extra source of stochasticity for such 
systems.
