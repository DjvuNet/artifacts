While the anatomy of the cerebellar microcircuit is well-studied, how it implements 
cerebellar function is not understood. A number of models have been proposed to 
describe this mechanism but few emphasize the role of the vast network Purkinje cells 
(PKJs) form with the molecular layer interneurons (MLIs)—the stellate and basket cells. 
We propose a model of the MLI-PKJ network composed of simple spiking neurons 
incorporating the major anatomical and physiological features. In computer simulations, 
the model reproduces the irregular ﬁring patterns observed in PKJs and MLIs in vitro and 
a shift toward faster, more regular ﬁring patterns when inhibitory synaptic currents are 
blocked. In the model, the time between PKJ spikes is shown to be proportional to the 
amount of feedfor ward inhibition from an MLI on average. The two key elements of the 
model are: (1) spontaneously active PKJs and MLIs due to an endogenous depolarizing 
current, and (2) adherence to known anatomical connectivity along a parasagittal strip of 
cerebellar cortex. We propose this model to extend previous spiking network models of 
the cerebellum and for further computational investigation into the role of irregular ﬁring 
and MLIs in cerebellar learning and function.

INTRODUCTION 
The cerebellum is thought to be involved in producing smooth 
and coordinated movements which are both spatially and tempo- 
rally precise. How the cerebellum achieves this is not understood. 
One approach to elucidate this mechanism is to construct a 
model from known anatomy and physiology to explain how 
the constituent neurons compute the function implemented by 
the cerebellum. Numerous theoretical and computational models 
have been proposed (Grossberg, 1969; Marr, 1969; Albus, 1971; 
Fujita, 1982; Medina et al., 2000; Dean et al., 2010; Yamazaki and 
Nagao, 2012), however few of these models emphasize the func- 
tional role of the molecular layer interneurons (MLIs). Typically, 
these inhibitory interneurons are described as providing “global 
inhibition” or “sculpting” the overall response of the Purkinje 
cells (PKJs); however, recent experimental evidence questions this 
hypothesis (Bower, 2010; Jorntell et al., 2010). We seek to under- 
stand the role of the MLIs in concert with the PKJs which they 
form a vast network with by means of computational modeling. 
A key feature of the network of MLIs and PKJs is that these 
neurons ﬁre spontaneously in absence of excitatory synaptic 
input (Hausser and Clark, 1997; Raman and Bean, 1997). When 
inhibitory synaptic currents are blocked in vitro, MLIs and PKJs 
ﬁre regularly (Hausser and Clark, 1997). In the presence of 
inhibitory synaptic currents, they exhibit relatively irregular ﬁr- 
ing. Understanding how PKJ spontaneous activity is modiﬁed to 
control their targets in the deep cerebellar nuclei and vestibular 
nuclei (DCN/VN) is central to understanding the operation of 
the cerebellar cortex. In conditioned eye blink response (CER) 
learning, PKJs learn to make an appropriately timed pause in 
ﬁring in response to a conditioned stimulus, which in turn dis- 
inhibits their DCN targets and elicits an eye blink (Jirenhed 
et al., 2007). Since PKJs are spontaneously active and blocking 
excitatory synaptic inputs to PKJs only modestly decreases the 
spontaneous PKJ activity in vivo (Cerminara and Rawson, 2004) 
and in vitro (Hausser and Clark, 1997), a decrease in efﬁcacy at 
parallel ﬁber (PF) to PKJ synapses is insufﬁcient to explain the 
learned pause in PKJ activity. Feedforward inhibition provided by 
MLIs may be one mechanism to produce this pause. Furthermore, 
using an optogenetic technique to increase the ﬁring rates of a 
target population of MLIs in awake mice, movements can be 
elicited and kinematics controlled by varying the photostimula- 
tion parameters (Heiney et al., 2014). Finally, in mutant mice 
lacking PKJ gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA)r

effectively removing MLI feedforward inhibition, motor learning 
deﬁcits are observed (Wulff et al., 2009). The accumulating evi- 
dence points to a greater functional role for MLIs than previous 
theories suggest. 
In this study we construct a spiking network model of spon- 
taneously active MLIs and PKJs composed of leaky integrate- 
and-ﬁre neuron models connected according to known anatomy. 
We show that despite using simple neuron models, this net- 
work reproduces the irregular ISIs observed in PKJs and MLIs 
in vitro. We further show that the relative contribution of MLI → 
MLI feedback inhibition to produce irregular ﬁring in MLIs is 
greater than the PKJ → MLI feedback inhibition contribution. 
Finally, this model provides a substrate for additional experiments

Spiking PKJ and MLI model 
investigating the functional role of irregular ﬁring patterns and 
MLIs in cerebellar learning and function. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
NETWORK MODEL 
The network is composed of PKJs and MLIs and is modeled 
after a 1 mm × 32 m microzone of the cerebellar cortex with 
the long axis extending parasagittally. In cats, 330 PKJs are con- 
tained within a 1 mm2 sheet of cerebellar cortex arranged in a 
grid-like arrangement (Palkovits et al., 1971). We therefore mod- 
eled 16 PKJs along a one dimensional grid with an even 64 m 
spacing between cell body centers and assume PKJ cell bodies are 
32 m in diameter. The network includes 160 MLIs in accordance 
with the anatomical data of a 10:1 ratio of MLIs to PKJs (Ko rbo 
et al., 1993). Thus, each PKJ has 10 nearest MLIs; three are des- 
ignated as lower molecular layer interneurons and are eligible to 
receive PKJ recurrent collaterals (described below). Figure 1 illus- 
trates the network and basic connectivity. Synapse formation in 
the network is probabilistic subject to the anatomical constraints 
described next. 
In vivo, PKJ recurrent collaterals extend parasagittally and can 
span more than 200 m, appearing to contact both PKJs and 
MLIs in the lower molecular layer (Chan-Palay, 1971; Hawkes and 
Leclerc, 1989; O’donoghue et al., 1989; Apps and Hawkes, 2009). 
Watt et al. (2009) showed PKJ recurrent collaterals extend asym- 
metrically and predominantly terminate within 100 mofthe 
parent cell soma but do not make functional synapses onto PKJs 
after post-natal day 21. To model this, PKJs in our network model 
extend their recurrent collaterals asymmetrically in the vicinity 
of the two nearest PKJs and can form synapses onto MLIs in 
the lower molecular layer, i.e., the ﬁrst three of 10 MLIs corre- 
sponding to a particular PKJ. We chose a probability of forming 
aPKJ→ MLI synapse such that, on average, each eligible MLI 
receives one PKJ input and each PKJ forms synapses onto three 
MLIs. Ta b l e 1 summarizes these convergence and divergence val- 
ues. We assume the model network belongs to an adult animal 
and do not allow PKJ to PKJ connections. 
In vivo, MLI axons extend parasagittally and terminate up to 
500 m away from the parent soma, contacting both PKJs and 
other MLIs (It ¯

extend asymmetrically and span a distance of eight PKJs. Each 
MLI axon branches in one direction or the other determined ran- 
domly with equal probability; i.e., an MLI can form synapses with 
MLIs and PKJs either to its left or to its right, but not both direc- 
tions. We chose a probability of forming MLI → PKJ synapses 
such that, on average, 20 MLIs formed synapses onto one PKJ, 
consistent with the anatomical data (Eccles et al., 1967; Palay and 
Chan-Palay, 1974). Synapse formation is determined by iterating 
through the list of candidate target neurons for a source neuron 
and randomly drawing a value from Unif(0,1);ifthedrawnvalue 
is less than some chosen probability, then a synapse is formed. 
Thus, all target neurons within the axon span had an equal prob- 
ability of forming a synapse whereas those neurons outside this 
distance had zero probability of forming synapses. We also chose 
a probability of forming MLI → MLI synapses such that, on aver- 
age, each MLI received inputs from four other MLIs, consistent 
with physiological data (Hausser and Clark, 1997; Kondo and 
Marty, 1998). While gap junctions between MLIs are known to 
exist (Mann-Metzer and Yarom, 1999), we chose to model only 
chemical synapses as a ﬁrst approximation to this network. 
Peak inhibitory post synaptic conductances (IPSCs) for each 
neuron type are summarized in Ta b l e 1 . These peak IPSCs are 
multiplied by synaptic weights, speciﬁc to each synapse (Equation 
2). Synaptic weights are drawn from a random distribution to 
simulate the diversity of synaptic conductances up to the peak 
conductance as observed in vitro (e.g., Kondo and Marty, 1998). 
MLI → MLI synapse weights are drawn from a uniform dis- 
tribution between 0 and 1, i.e., wMLI→MLI ∼ Unif (0, 1); also, 
wMLI→PKJ ∼ Unif (0, 1.25) and wPKJ→MLI ∼ Unif (0, 1). 
NEURON MODEL 
Neurons are modeled as conductance-based leaky integrate-and- 
ﬁre units (Gerstner and Kistler, 2002). The membrane potential, 
V(t), is governed by Equation (1), where C is the mem- 
brane capacitance, gleak is a constant leak conductance, gahp(t) 
is an after-hyperpolarization (AHP) conductance (described by 
Equation 4), gGABA(t) is the inhibitory GABA conductance and 
Ispont (t) is a spontaneous depolarizing current (described below). 
Eleak , Eahp, EGABA are the respective reversal potentials. Ta b l e 1 
summarizes the physiological values used in the neuron models 
FIGURE 1 | A schematic of the model network. 160 MLIs (red) and 16 PKJs 
(blue) were simulated. Each PKJ has 10 corresponding MLIs that are closest 
to it along the long axis. Of the 10 closest, three are eligible to receive PKJ 
recurrent collaterals (shown in a lighter shade of red) and seven are ineligible 
to receive PKJ recurrent collaterals (shown in a darker shade of red). 
Examples of allowed connections are shown. All synapses are inhibitory. 
Further details on the network connectivity are described in the Methods 
Section.

(4) 
The spontaneous ﬁring activity of MLIs and PKJs has been 
shown to be an intrinsic neuron property and not driven by 
the background activity of parallel ﬁbers (Hausser and Clark, 
1997). In PKJs, the spontaneous ﬁring is primarily mediated by 
tetrodotoxin (TTX) sensitive sodium channels which produce 
a sub-threshold depolarizing current (Raman and Bean, 1999). 
While the mechanism for this endogenous current in MLIs is 
not well-studied, MLIs presumably share a similar mechanism 
to PKJs since blocking TTX-sensitive sodium channels abolishes 
this sub-threshold depolarizing response in MLIs (Midtgaard, 
1992). To model this spontaneous activity of MLIs and PKJs, 
we inject a random depolarizing current drawn from a gamma 
distribution, Ispont(t) ∼ Ŵ(κ, β) (in units of nA), every time 
step of the simulation. A gamma distribution was chosen since 
its support is strictly non-negative and has ﬂexible shape and

grid search over κ and β for MLIs and PKJs separately to ﬁnd 
the parameters which resulted in the neuron model reproduc- 
ing the mean ﬁring rate and inter-spike interval coefﬁcient of 
variation (CV) that was close to the example data reported in 
Hausser and Clark (1997) in the presence of GABA blockers. 
Ta b l e 1 summarizes gamma distribution parameters for each 
neuron type. Figures 2, 3A–C show the resulting neuron model 
activity when neurons are isolated, i.e., no synaptic inputs are 
present. 
We used the PKJ model parameters from Yamazaki and Nagao 
(2012) but replaced the constant spontaneous current with one 
drawn from a gamma distribution. A single neuron model for 
basket and stellate cells was derived from physiological data 
reported in the literature (Ta b l e 1 ). Anatomical and physiolog- 
ical evidence suggests that basket and stellate cells belong to 
one homogenous group of interneurons whose properties vary 
smoothly by depth of the soma in the molecular layer (Sultan and 
Bower, 1998; Ruigrok et al., 2011; Chu et al., 2012)andwhich 
share common receptive ﬁeld properties (Jorntell and Ekerot, 
2003). Since PKJs and MLIs are modeled as single compartment 
neuron models, we combine the effects of stellate-type synapses 
onto the PKJ dendrites with basket-type synapses onto the PKJ 
somas (Eccles et al., 1967; Palay and Chan-Palay, 1974)bymod- 
eling a single idealized MLI that makes synapses of one type onto 
the model PKJ. 
SOFTWARE AND DATA ANALYSIS 
Simulations were performed using BRIAN Simulator, a Python 
library for spiking neural network simulations (Goodman and 
Brette, 2009). Simulations were carried out using Euler’s method 
for temporal integration with a time step of 0.25 ms for numerical 
stability. Data analysis and plotting were performed using BRIAN 
Simulator, SciPy, Matplotlib, Plotly and custom software written 
in Python. The source code is freely available online at: http://dx.

RESULTS 
MODEL PKJs AND MLIs IN ISOLATION EXHIBIT REGULAR FIRING 
First, we examined the spike patterns of isolated MLI and PKJ 
neuron models (no synaptic currents) with spontaneous depolar- 
izing currents. The top rows of Figures 2, 3 show the response of 
a model MLI and PKJ, respectively, under these conditions. The 
random current was sufﬁcient to drive the neuron past thresh- 
old potential to ﬁre spontaneously (Figures 2, 3A). A histogram 
of the inter-spike intervals (ISIs) reveals the degree of regularity 
of ﬁring by the average baseline ﬁring rate of the neuron and 
variability in timing between spike pairs (Figures 2, 3B). These 
results are consistent with MLIs and PKJs recorded in vitro when 
GABAergic transmission has been blocked chemically (Hausser 
and Clark, 1997).Them

Spiking PKJ and MLI model 
MLI appeared slightly more skewed toward longer ISIs compared 
to the in vitro data, possibly due to longer recording times of 
300 s in our experiments. While the model PKJ ISI histogram 
appeared symmetric, it failed a test of normality (Shapiro-Wilk 
test, p < 10 12) as did the MLI ISI histogram (Shapiro-Wilk test, 
p < 10 38). Tests of normality were not reported by Hausser 
and Clark (1997), though the authors noted Gaussian-shaped 
ISI histograms. A spike autocorrelogram revealed regularity in 
trains of successive spikes with several peaks at integer multiples 
of the baseline frequency (Figures 2, 3C). These results suggest 
that a simple neuron model with a spontaneous random cur- 
rent is capable of reproducing similar spike timing phenomena 
as observed in vitro under conditions of GABAergic transmission 
block. 
MODEL PKJs AND MLIs IN THE NETWORK EXHIBIT IRREGULAR FIRING 
Next, we examined the spike patterns of interconnected, sponta- 
neously active MLI and PKJ neurons in a network (Figure 1). We 
usedthesameneuronmodelsforMLIandPKJneurons,respec- 
tively, with dynamics depicted in the top panels of Figures 2, 3, 
to form the network. Despite the same prototypical MLI and 
PKJ being used repeatedly, the random connectivity and random 
synaptic weight assigned when constructing the network resulted 
in a diversity of neuron responses (Figure 4) with MLI mean ﬁr- 
ing rates of 13.1 8.0 Hz (n = 160, range: 0.2–29.2 Hz) and PKJ 
mean ﬁring rates of 25.9 3.5 Hz (n = 16, range: 19.1–33.1 Hz). 
The ﬁring patterns of MLIs and PKJs in the network changed sub- 
stantially due to the constant bombardment by inhibitory postsy- 
naptic currents (IPSCs) from presynaptic neurons. The decreased 
ﬁring rate and irregular spiking of these neurons is apparent in 
a trace of the membrane potential (Figures 2, 3D). The ISI his- 
togram becomes signiﬁcantly skewed favoring longer and more 
irregular ISIs (Figures 2, 3E). MLI ISI coefﬁcients of variation 
increased markedly from the isolated case to 0.61 0.24 (range: 
0.14–1.04; n = 160), as did the PKJ ISI CVs 0.28 0.04 (range: 
0.21–0.39; n = 16). Hausser and Clark (1997) reported ISI coef- 
ﬁcients in control conditions of 0.51 0.024 (range: 0.19–0.85; 
n = 43) for MLIs and 0.28 0.038 (n = 160, range: 0.05–1.13; 
n = 68) for PKJs. We also found examples of both MLIs and PKJs 
in the model network that closely matched exemplar neurons 
reported in vitro data in control conditions. A model PKJ found in 
the network produces a mean ﬁring rate of 24.5 Hz and an ISI CV 
of 0.30 compared to 35 Hz and 0.49, respectively, for an exemplar 
neuron in vitro (Hausser and Clark, 1997). A model MLI found 
in the network produces a mean ﬁring rate of 17.8 Hz and an 
ISI CV of 0.43 compared to 15 Hz and 0.40, respectively, for an 
exemplar neuron in vitro (Hausser and Clark, 1997). It should 
be noted that the background activity of parallel ﬁber input is 
present in control conditions reported for in vitro data but was 
shown to contribute only a modest increase in MLI and PKJ ﬁring 
ratesinaseparateexperimentofthesamestudy.Noparallelﬁber 
background activity is present in this model. A signiﬁcant corre- 
lationbetweenmeanﬁringrateandCVwasfoundinbothMLIs 
(Spearman rank-order coefﬁcient r = 0.996, p < 10 167)and 
PKJs (Spearman rank-order coefﬁcient r = 0.991, p < 10 12). 
Many of the peaks in the spike autocorrelogram disappeared sug- 
gesting that trains of spikes are no longer regularly spaced. These

results suggest that a simple neuron model of spontaneously 
active MLIs and PKJs when interconnected in accordance with 
known anatomy is capable of reproducing the irregular ﬁring pat- 
terns of MLIs and PKJs observed in vitro. Finally, analyses of the 
consistency of the model results among different random instan- 
tiations of the network constrained by the same parameters and 
of the robustness of the model to random perturbations in the 
parameters of up to 10% of the original values were performed 
(Figures S1–S3). These results suggest the model reproduces sim- 
ilar results under different random instantiations of the network 
(Figures S1, S2) and is robust to small changes in the parameters 
(Figure S3). 
FEEDFORWARD INHIBITION PRODUCES VARIABLE DELAYS IN THE 
POSTSYNAPTIC NEURON 
Next, we ran simulations to illustrate the effect of feedforward 
inhibition on the membrane potential of PKJs between successive 
spikes. Multiple traces of the membrane potential of an iso- 
lated PKJ showing two successive spikes are aligned to the ﬁrst 
spike and overlaid (Figure 5A). Action potential waveforms have 
been artiﬁcially drawn since the leaky integrate-and-ﬁre model 
does not explicitly model the membrane potential during action 
potentials. The random spontaneous current resulted in variable 
delays between spikes. A model MLI was then synaptically con- 
nected providing feedforward inhibition onto the PKJ with a peak 
IPSC of 4 nS. The MLI was triggered to ﬁre 12 ms after the PKJ’s 
ﬁrst spike. The effect of feedforward inhibition from the MLI to

relationship between IPSC and ISI can be seen by varying the synaptic 
conductance randomly in separate trials and measuring the resulting ISI. 
the PKJ delays the time of the second PKJ spike (Figure 5B). The 
mean delay with feedforward inhibition is signiﬁcant (Mann– 
Whitney U -test, p < 10 96, n = 500) (Figure 5C). Moreover, a 
linear relationship between the peak IPSC and the ISI can be 
seen (Figure 5D). This suggests the mean ISI is a function of 
the total synaptic conductance during the interval preceding the 
second spike. More elaborate methods for characterizing the 
response of neurons to synaptic input, such as measuring the 
phase response curves (PRC) of PKJs (Phoka et al., 2010), can 
be straightforwardly applied to this model in future work. 
THE EFFECTS OF REMOVING MLI → MLI OR PKJ → MLI SYNAPSES 
Finally, to explore the effects of MLI → MLI and PKJ → MLI con- 
nections on the baseline activity of the network, we simulated the 
network activity when a random subset of synapses from one con- 
nection type or the other were randomly pruned (i.e., removed). 
We simulated scenarios where a random subset of 25, 50, or 75% 
of the original MLI → MLI or PKJ → MLI synapses were pruned, 
as well as when the network is fully intact (0%) or all synapses of 
that connection type are removed (100%) (Figure 6). The activity 
of each neuron was recorded for 60 s and a mean ﬁring rate and 
mean ISI CV were calculated for each neuron in each neuron-type 
population. The median (i.e., second quartile) of each popula- 
tion for both measures was computed and is depicted with ﬁlled 
circles. The ﬁrst and third quartiles for each measure was also 
computed and is depicted with bars—where the lower bar is the 
ﬁrst quartile and the upper bar is the third quartile—to show 
the distribution of values across the population. The population 
mean was also computed and is depicted by a cross in a con- 
trasting color. As more MLI → MLIsyn

ed,the 
MLI ﬁring rates (Figure 6, top-left panel, dark red line) increase 
due to decreased mutual inhibition. The MLI ISI CVs (light 
red) decrease due to increased regularity in ﬁring. The result of 
increased MLI ﬁring is increased inhibition onto PKJs, result- 
ing in decreased PKJ ﬁring rates (Figure 6, lower-left panel) and 
increased PKJ ISI CVs. In contrast to the signiﬁcant changes in 
MLI and PKJ ﬁring rates and ISI CVs when MLI → MLI synapses 
are pruned, pruning PKJ → MLI synapses has only a subtle effect 
on the activity of MLIs (Figure 6, top-right) and PKJs (Figure 6, 
bottom-right). Statistical tests show that the difference between 
population ﬁring rates in the fully intact network (0%) and the 
fully pruned PKJ → MLI connections (100%) is not signiﬁcant 
for MLIs (Mann–Whitney U -test, p > 0.13, n = 160) or PKJs 
(Mann–Whitney U -test, p > 0.19, n = 16). These results show

Spiking PKJ and MLI model 
FIGURE 6 | Changes in network activity by pruning MLI → MLI or PKJ → 
MLI synapses. Simulations were performed where a random set of 
synapses of either MLI → MLI or PKJ → MLI connections were removed 
from the model network to investigate the effect of these connection types 
on the activity of the network. Left column: measurements of MLI population 
(top row, in red) and PKJ population (bottom row, in blue) ﬁring rates (darker 
shade) and ISI CVs (lighter shade) when MLI → MLI synapses are randomly 
pruned by 25, 50, and 75% as well as fully intact (0%) and fully pruned 
(100%, i.e., no MLI → MLI left synapses at all). Each neuron’s mean ﬁring 
rate and ISI CV was measured over a 60 s simulation of the operation of the 
network. Solid circles denote the median of the population for each of these 
statistics. Bars show the ﬁrst and third quartile to depict the distribution of 
values across the population. The cross mark denotes the population mean. 
Right column: similar measurements in the case of PKJ → MLI synapses 
pruned. Top-left panel: As more MLI → MLI synapses are pruned, the median 
ﬁring rate of the population of MLIs (dark red) increases due to decreased 
mutual inhibition. When the synapses are completely pruned, there is very 
little variance in the population response and quartile bars overlap with the 
ﬁlled circle and are not visible. Additionally, the median ISI CV decreases as 
more MLI → MLI synapses are pruned (light pink). Bottom-left: As more 
MLI → MLI synapses are pruned, inhibition onto PKJs from MLIs increases, 
thus decreasing the median PKJ population ﬁring rate (dark blue) and 
increases the median PKJ ISI CV (light blue). Top-right: pruning PKJ → MLI 
synapses has only a subtle effect on the MLI population median ﬁring right 
and ISI CV. Bottom right: similarly, pruning PKJ → MLI synapses has only a 
subtle effect on the PKJ population median ﬁring right and ISI CV. 
that MLI → MLI mutual inhibition has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on 
the baseline activity of the network by governing the average ﬁr- 
ing rate and variability of spike timing of MLIs and PKJs whereas 
the effect of PKJ → MLI connections on the baseline activity of 
the network is more subtle. 
DISCUSSION 
In this study, we demonstrate that a network composed of sim- 
ple neuron models of MLIs and PKJs is sufﬁcient to reproduce 
the irregular ﬁring patterns of their biological counterparts as 
observed in vitro. The key elements to the model are neurons 
with endogenous depolarizing currents that are interconnected 
via inhibitory synapses in accordance with known anatomy. The 
random endogenous current drives each neuron to spike in the 
absence of all input to the neuron in a regular but still vari- 
able way. In the event of an inhibitory input from another 
neuron, the membrane potential of the target neuron is temporar- 
ily decreased, requiring more spontaneous depolarizing current 
and thereby more time to reach threshold, resulting in a longer 
inter-spike interval. The time between two spikes is dependent 
on the amount of the endogenous current and the amount of 
inhibitory post synaptic conductance. The results suggest that a 
more elaborate neuron model is not necessary to reproduce these 
phenomena. In addition, simulations investigating the relative 
importance of MLI → MLI and PKJ → MLI connections on reg- 
ulating the baseline activity of the network revealed the signiﬁcant 
role of MLI mutual inhibition to achieve results matching in vitro 
data and relatively subtle role of MLI → PKJ synapses. Finally, 
this network model provides a substrate for additional experi- 
mental investigation into the role of MLIs in cerebellar learning 
and function. 
IMPLICATIONS OF IRREGULAR FIRING 
Whether irregular ﬁring has a functional role or is simply a 
consequence of interconnected spontaneously active neurons is 
not clear. Some evidence suggests a functional role for these 
ﬁring patterns. Wulff et al. (2009) found that genetically modi- 
ﬁedmicelackingPKJGABAA receptors exhibited normal motor 
performance but were unable to consolidate motor learning fol- 
lowing VOR gain down training. Interestingly, while the ISIs of 
PKJs were more regular in the genetically modiﬁed mice com- 
pared to control, the mean ﬁring rate was nearly the same. 
Motor learning in the cerebellum may initially take place in the 
cortex and then be partially transferred to the deep cerebellar 
nuclei/vestibular nuclei (DCN/VN) where it is consolidated for 
long-term storage (Kassardjian et al., 2005; Shutoh et al., 2006). 
While the overall quantity of PKJ inhibition onto their targets 
in the DCN/VN is unchanged in knockout mice, the quality

Lennon et al. 
Spiking PKJ and MLI model 
of PKJ ﬁring patterns may be enough to disrupt consolidation 
of memory to the DCN/VN and could explain the failure of 
knockout mice to consolidate VOR gain down learning. This 
is consistent with electrophysiological results showing that PKJ 
inhibition onto DCN/VN targets controls learning at mossy ﬁber 
(MF) to DCN/VN synapses (McElvain et al., 2010; Person and 
Raman, 2010), a putative location for memory consolidation. 
Mechanistically, irregular PKJ ﬁring may favor rebound depolar- 
izations (RDs) occurring in PKJ targets in DCN/VN (Aizenman 
and Linden, 1999) by providing a period of intense inhibition 
followed by a period of relative relief, which in turn may con- 
trol learning at DCN/VN synapses (Pugh and Raman, 2008). In 
the absence of spontaneous feedforward inhibition provided by 
MLIs,thePKJsﬁremoreregularlyandpreventDCN/VNtargets 
from ﬁring appropriately, possibly resulting in impaired mem- 
ory transfer. However, too much feedforward inhibition leads to 
more irregular PKJ ﬁring (Figure 6), which might also interfere 
with learning or motor performance. Episodic ataxia type-2 is a 
condition caused by mutations to P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium 
channels expressed in PKJs which leads to increased irregular- 
ity in PKJ ﬁring and impaired motor performance (Walter et al. , 
2006). Thus, feedforward inhibition onto PKJs must be carefully 
balanced to achieve stable learning and motor performance. 
The irregular ﬁring of PKJs may also be a means of preventing 
synchronous PKJ activity during periods of rest when the cere- 
bellar cortex is not actively emitting control signals. If many PKJs 
did synchronize their ﬁring in response to input stimulus, then 
the summed activity could encode a sequence of ON periods, 
when most PKJs are ﬁring, and OFF periods, when most PKJs 
are silent. Maex and De Schutter (2003) showed computationally 
that the synaptic conductance delay in a homogeneous network of 
inhibitory neurons is the primary parameter controlling the fre- 
quency of synchronicity among these neurons. While this model 
does not implement spike propagation or synaptic transmission 
delays, this could be one way of evoking synchronized activity 
among MLIs and PKJs. This ON-OFF pattern might be a means of 
implementing Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), a digital control 
signal used to represent analog values. Person and Raman (2012) 
found that many synchronous inhibitory inputs to a neuron in 
the DCN/VN can entrain the neuron to ﬁre at a high and regu- 
lar rate. This ﬁring rate could be the analog value desired by the 
PWM control scheme. On the other hand, if irregular ﬁring pre- 
vents PKJ synchrony during behavior as well, then the summed 
activity of asynchronous PKJs could represent an analog value for 
control of the DCN/VN targets. It is also possible that PKJs can 
switch between operating modes to convey the most appropriate 
control signal. 
FUNCTION OF MLI-PKJ NETWORK 
A more general inquiry is into the functional role of spon- 
taneously active PKJs and MLIs. One advantage of sponta- 
neously active neurons is that their ﬁring rates can be both 
increased and decreased, by excitation and inhibition, respec- 
tively. Presumably, PKJs need to actively inhibit their DCN/VN 
targets which are spontaneously active and exhibit rebound 
depolarizations (Aizenman and Linden, 1999). Tonic inhibition 
by PKJs can be increased and possibly synchronized by excitatory 
PF inputs which could hyperpolarize or entrain DCN/VN targets. 
A decrease in PKJ tonic activity, via MLI feedforward inhibition, 
disinhibits DCN/VN targets. Such a scheme would allow for sev- 
eral modes of control and a similar argument can be made for the 
spontaneously active MLIs. 
A key feature present in this model is MLI → MLI and PKJ → 
MLI inhibition. In the model, MLI → MLI inhibition is shown 
to have a signiﬁcant effect on regulating the baseline ﬁring rate 
and spike regularity in both MLIs and PKJs (Figure 6). As dis- 
cussed, a careful balance between these two properties may be 
needed to ensure effective motor performance and learning. The 
presence of MLI → MLI inhibition also theoretically allows for 
competition among MLIs to take place in response to PF stim- 
uli. Electrophysiological evidence suggests an activity dependent 
form of learning at PF-MLI synapses may exist (Liu and Cull- 
Candy, 2000; Rancillac and Crepel, 2004; Smith and Otis, 2005, 
but see also Jorntell and Ekerot, 2002). If this is correct, a diverse 
set of MLI receptive ﬁelds and responses could emerge from this 
competition. Plasticity at MLI → PKJ synapses (Gao et al., 2012) 
could enable PKJs to learn the most appropriate set of inhibitory 
inputs to achieve the desired output response. While the anatom- 
ical data on MLI → PKJ convergence between cat and rat differs 
(Eccles et al., 1967; Palay and Chan-Palay, 1974), plasticity at these 
synapses could also tune the total inhibitory conductance onto a 
PKJ to ensure that the baseline PKJ activity is appropriate. In the 
present model, this would be achieved by altering the synaptic 
weights. In another computer model, PKJ → PKJ feedback inhi- 
bitionenablesPKJsinanetworkwithMLIstoperformtemporal 
integration on a time-scale of seconds (Maex and Steuber, 2013); 
theroleofMLI→ MLI and PKJ → MLI inhibition may serve 
a similar function. In contrast, PKJ → MLI connections appear 
to have only a small effect on the resting activity of the network 
(Figure 6). Taken together, these ideas suggest the information 
storage capacity and expressiveness of the PKJ-MLI network is 
even greater than previous theories describe (Brunel et al., 2004; 
Clopath et al., 2012). The model proposed here provides an ini- 
tial step toward carrying out further computational investigations 
into these questions. 
COMPARISON WITH OTHER MODELS 
De Schutter and Bower (1994b) model a Purkinje cell as a 
Hodgkin-Huxley-type, multi-compartmental model that repro- 
duces asymmetric ISI distributions in response to PF and MLI 
inputs. However, in these experiments the model PKJ relies exclu- 
sively on PF inputs to drive spiking and not an endogenous 
depolarizing current. Further the inﬂuence of MLIs is mod- 
eled indirectly as Poisson spike trains which assumes the ISI 
distribution is exponential, whereas our model generates MLI 
spikes by simulating MLI dynamics directly and results in an 
appropriate ISI distribution. Finally, by simulating the network 
of MLIs and PKJs, our model enables simulating the response 
of the MLI-PKJ network to PF input to investigate cerebellar 
function. Previous computational network models of the cerebel- 
lum that include MLIs typically ignore a number of anatomical 
or physiological facts. For example, models do not include the 
spontaneous activity of MLIs (Yamazaki and Nagao, 2012)o

and Steuber, 2013). Adaptive ﬁlter models implicitly model the 
inhibitory effect of MLIs by allowing the PF-PKJ ﬁlter weights 
to be negative (Fujita, 1982; Dean et al., 2010). While our net- 
work models a parasagittal strip of cerebellar cortex, other work 
has modeled a medio-lateral strip to investigate the effects of 
spontaneously active MLIs on PKJs along a beam of PF inputs 
(Santamaria et al., 2007). Further effort to extend the model pro- 
posed in our study to include the medio-lateral axis would be 
worthwhile.
