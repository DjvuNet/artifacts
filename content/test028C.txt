Abstract 
Based on (i) an analysis of the regularities in the standard genetic code and (ii) comparative 
genomics of the anticodon modification machinery in the three branches of life, we derive 
the tRNA set and its anticodon modifications as it was present in LUCA. Previously we pro- 
posed that an early ancestor of LUCA contained a set of 23 tRNAs with unmodified antico- 
dons that was capable of translating all 20 amino acids while reading 55 of the 61 sense 
codons of the standard genetic code (SGC). Here we use biochemical and genomic evi- 
dence to derive that LUCA contained a set of 44 or 45 tRNAs containing 2 or 3 modifications 
while reading 59 or 60 of the 61 sense codons. Subsequent tRNA modifications occurred 
independently in the Bacteria and Eucarya, while the Archaea have remained quite close to 
the tRNA set as it was present in LUCA. 
Introduction 
Towards analyzing the middle stage of the evolution of the SGC 
The evolutionary origin of the standard genetic code (SGC) is widely viewed as a central open 
problem in the evolution of life [1–4]. Key questions in the field focus on early steps in the evo- 
lution of the SGC, such as: what is the origin of the first tRNA and what is the amino acid that 
it encoded; how did this first tRNA give rise to a set of 20 encoded amino acids? Here we con- 
sider events in a later stage of the evolution of the code involving anticodon modifications that 
affect the readout properties of tRNAs. With the availability of complete genomes of hundreds 
of organisms from all three domains, the possibility emerges for a meaningful investigation of 
the tRNA set of the last universal common ancestor (LUCA). Here we will focus on recon- 
structing the anticodon modifications which were used in the tRNA set of LUCA. 
While the genetic code is at the core of all known cellular life, its evolutionary origin remains 
only very partially understood. We propose to distinguish three stages in the evolution of the 
genetic code. During the first stage, the genetic code emerged and evolved from a system with 
few amino acids to a system with the current twenty amino acids. This stage involved a small

number of tRNAs and no anticodon modifications, and as a result not all codons were read 
efficiently (see below). During stage 2 (the “middle stage”), the readout properties of the tRNA 
sets were improved through evolutionary development of modifications of the bases in the 
anticodon. In addition, release factor proteins evolved to increase the efficiency of translational 
termination. With the help of anticodon modifications all 61 sense codons could be recognized 
quickly and unambiguously by the tRNA set. These events resulted in the evolution of the 
modern SGC. Currently it is not clear if this second stage was already completed in LUCA. 
During stage 3, small variations in the SGC evolved in a limited number of present-day line- 
ages. All of these minor code variations are present in relatively small, taxonomically coherent 
groups of current organisms and their origin can be traced back to a small modification in the 
genetic code in a relatively recent common ancestor that carried the SGC [5–7]. These genetic 
code variants therefore arose post-LUCA during the last ~3 billion years. The evolution of such 
a new code variant occurs during a relatively short period in which the “frozen accident” [8]of 
the SGC briefly thaws between long eras of codon assignment stasis. The proposed stages 1 and 
2 of genetic code evolution (during which the SGC emerged and froze) occurred almost 
completely (see below) pre-LUCA during the first ~1.5 billion years of earth’s history. 
Biochemical understanding of the fundamental regularity in the SGC 
A large body of literature exists on both stages 1 and 3. Stage 1 is the most challenging to 
address. Stage 3 has been well documented and is well understood (see e.g. [9] and references 
therein). However, little attention has been paid to stage 2. In [10], we drew attention to the 
fact that a relatively small tRNA set with unmodified anticodons is able to unambiguously read 
more than 80% of the codons of the genetic code. As discussed below, evidence has accumu- 
lated [11–14] that an important fundamental regularity exists in the SGC, which provides key 
constraints on its evolutionary origin. Here we further explore the implications of this regular- 
ity in the SGC for the evolutionary pathway that resulted in its development. 
We focus on the regularity that the 16 codon boxes (defined as the set of four triplets sharing 
the first two nucleotides) are divided exactly in two groups of 8 codon boxes each: the 8 four- 
fold degenerate codon boxes, and the 8 split codon boxes. Furthermore, this neat division in 
two groups of 32 codons is not a random division: to the contrary, it is extremely regular. The 4 
SSN codon boxes (where S stands for G or C) all belong to the fourfold degenerate group of 
codon boxes; the 4 WWN codon boxes (where W stands for A or U) all belong to the group of 
split codon boxes. The extremely regular division also extends to the remaining 8 codon boxes. 
These are characterized by a mix of S and W nucleotides in the first two codon positions and 
form a “chess board pattern” in the genetic code table (see Fig 1). The four NYN codon boxes 
(Y denotes a pyrimidine: C or U) from this group (UCN, CUN, ACN, and GUN) all belong to 
the group of fourfold degenerate codon boxes. The four NRN codon boxes (where R denotes a 
purine: A or G) from this group (UGN, CAN, AGN, and GAN) all belong to the group of split 
codon boxes. The “chess board” is therefore precisely divided into a left half and a right half: 
the UCN, CUN, ACN, and GUN codon boxes in the left half are fourfold degenerate codon 
boxes, and the UGN, CAN, AGN, and GAN codon boxes in the right half are split codon 
boxes. The role of S and W nucleotides in this exact division points to the role of codon-antico- 
don pairing strength in this regularity. 
This regular pattern of exactly splitting the 64 codons into 32 codons belonging to 8 fourfold 
degenerate codon boxes and 32 codons belonging to 8 split codon boxes was pointed out in 
1966 [15]. However, apart from a number of notable exceptions (e.g. [14,16,17]), it has since 
mostly been ignored. Here we return to this regularity and explore its implications for the evo- 
lution of the SGC.

In an important contribution, Lehmann and Libchaber [11] explained the molecular raison 
d’etre of this presence of two types of codon boxes, distributed exactly evenly over the code 
table: a stabilizing hydrogen bond from U33 towards the middle purine of the anticodon (note 
that a middle pyrimidine in the codon interacts with a middle purine in the anticodon) is 
responsible for the ability of U-starting anticodons (with unmodified U) in the UCN, CUN, 
ACN, and GUN codon boxes to read all 4 codons with approximately equal efficiency [11]. In 
split codon boxes with mixed S and W nucleotides in the first two positions, such a fourfold 
superwobble [18] is not possible. In these codon boxes, U-starting anticodons (with unmodi- 
fied U) efficiently pair with the R-ending codons, but not with the Y-ending codons. This effect 
does not result in a total absence of pairing: suppression (see below) can happen when no able 
competitor for pairing is present (see [19,20]). 
The superwobble (which does not involve suppression) was biochemically demonstrated for 
tRNAGlyUCC [12] and was shown to be dependent on the phenomenon of bridging water mole- 
cules between the two bases involved in molecular dynamics simulation [13]. These bridging 
water molecules provide an appealing explanation of the failure of Crick’s classic argument 
that Y-Y pairs would be too short (see the legend of Fig 6 in [21]:”The wobble code suggested 
uses the four positions to the right of the diagram, but not the three close positions”). From a 
genomics perspective, the superwobble was demonstrated to be present in many fourfold 
degenerate codon boxes in many bacterial species [14]. The evolutionary raison d’etre of the 
exact division (i.e. bifurcation) in fourfold degenerate codon boxes and split codon boxes has 
not been addressed and is examined here. 
Fig 1. The chess board pattern in the genetic code table. When all SSN and WWN codon boxes are left 
out, a chess board pattern emerges (see text). In this representation it can immediately be seen that mixed 
SW/WS codon boxes with a middle-Y (U or C) are fourfold degenerate codon boxes, while mixed SW/WS 
codon boxes with a middle-R (A or G) are split codon boxes.

Results and Discussion 
Evolutionary origin of the fourfold degenerate/split codon box regularity 
in the SGC based on wobble behavior of tRNA sets with unmodified 
anticodons 
Here we examine the implications of the wobble behavior of tRNAs with unmodified antico- 
dons for the evolutionary origin of the regularity in number and amino acid assignment of the 
two types of codon boxes in the SGC. In developing molecular scenarios for this stage of the 
evolution of the genetic code we use three general considerations. First, it appears likely that 
during the earlier stages of the evolution of the SGC the accuracy of genome repair and replica- 
tion systems was substantially lower than it is in most present-day cells. As a result, because of 
the looming of Eigen and Schuster’s error catastrophe [22], strong selective pressure existed to 
achieve all cellular processes, including translation, with as few components as possible. 
The importance of both the speed and accuracy of translation as selective pressures that 
drive codon bias in present-day organisms has been established [14]. Here we argue that during 
the earlier stages of the evolution of the SGC a third selective pressure played a major role: to 
perform translation with components using the smallest possible genome size. This argument 
hinges on the notion that during these stages of evolution of the genetic code the effective 
genome size of these early systems was considerably smaller than in present-day organisms. 
The importance of this consideration for the work reported here is that it favors scenarios in 
which no machinery for base modifications is involved, resulting in the occurrence of tRNAs 
with unmodified anticodons. 
As a second principle in guiding the development of scenarios for the early evolution of the 
genetic code, we invoke the stabilizing effect resulting from the occurrence of a sufficiently 
large number of codons in a genome. When codons are present in sufficiently large numbers, 
protein residues occur where the presence of a certain amino acid side chain is essential. Even 
if only one such position is vital, the system cannot survive without the ability to translate this 
position in the correct way. As a result, the SGC is quite stable. This concept has become well 
known as part of the frozen accident theory [8], but actually is older [23] (also see [4]). The 
principle that a feature that is in general use cannot be lost without severe consequences was 
elaborated more recently [24]. The stabilizing effect of this principle on the genetic code is 
referred to as the proteomic constraint on the genetic code. This proteomic constraint is pro- 
portional to the size of the proteome, measured as P, the number of codons in a genome [24]. 
If P is small (e.g. smaller than 100,000, which is the case for the set of 13 protein-encoding 
genes in a mammalian mitochondrial genome), then changes in the genetic code can occur rel- 
atively easily (see also [9] and references therein). 
Third, in the evolutionary scenario reported here we consider the phenomenon that to a cer- 
tain extent anticodons are able to read (albeit with reduced efficiency) codons outside their 
canonical group of codons. This effect has been experimentally observed in cases in which a 
specific tRNA is absent but the codons that are canonically read by the missing tRNA are being 
read by an alternative anticodon. This process is referred to as the suppression of a potentially 
highly detrimental situation in which a codon is formally unassigned but in fact is translated by 
a different tRNA through non-canonical codon-anticodon pairing. Please note that the use of 
the term suppression is potentially confusing (see [25]). The term suppression by tRNAs was 
originally used to describe suppressor mutations in which a lethal mutation to an in-frame stop 
codon was suppressed by a mutation in a tRNA that allowed the in-frame stop codon to be 
read as a sense codon. Söll and co-workers [25] refer to “introducing new amino acid assign- 
ments of one or more codons without removing the original function (e.g. UAG decoded as 
both a stop codon and an amino acid [26])” as codon suppression. In this study, we use the

term suppression for those cases in which a tRNA reads (with reduced efficiency) a codon out- 
side its normal group of recognized codons. 
Based on the evolutionary pressure to perform translation with the smallest effective tRNA 
set, we propose that early in the evolution of the genetic code all 4 codons in a fourfold degen- 
erate codon box were translated by the U-starting anticodon as the single anticodon. Strong 
biochemical evidence for this proposal has been reported [12]. For example, in the scenario 
proposed here the UCN codon box was translated by a single tRNA with anticodon UGA. In 
the case that the UGA anticodon mutated to one of the three other anticodons (GGA, AGA, 
CGA) working in the same codon box, a suboptimal situation had come into existence. If, in 
the example of the UCN codon box, the anticodon changed from UGA to GGA, the UCR 
codons were not read efficiently because a tRNA with the GGA anticodon was less adapt at 
reading UCR codons compared with UGA. While G-starting anticodons in many cases can 
suppress A-ending codons (see [27]), translation is often impaired. For G-ending codons, sup- 
pression by G-starting anticodons is problematic. These biochemical results on present-day 
organisms (see e.g. [27,28]) indicate that the UGA anticodon in fact was present at a much 
higher frequency than its GGA, AGA or CGA variants during early stages of the evolution of 
the genetic code. This frequency distribution resulted from the balance between point muta- 
tions leading to the introduction of these anticodons and negative selection leading to their 
removal. 
The relevance of the proteomic constraint for the evolution of the genetic code as consid- 
ered here is that the presence of vital UCR codons in a genome will cause the mutation of the 
UGA anticodon to GGA to strongly reduce fitness. Therefore, in fourfold degenerate codon 
boxes, where one single tRNA without anticodon modification is able to efficiently read all 4 
codons, during the early evolution of the genetic code the proteomic constraint on the genetic 
code maintains the first position of the anticodon as U. 
In contrast to the situation described above for fourfold degenerate codon boxes, in the case 
of split codon boxes (such as UUN), biochemical considerations indicate that the U-starting 
anticodon was not the preferred anticodon. The key factor is that when the superwobble is not 
possible, selection during the early evolution of the genetic code will favor the presence of two 
distinct tRNA genes, one with a G-starting anticodon which will efficiently read the Y-ending 
codons, and one with a C-starting anticodon which will efficiently read the G-ending codon. 
Diversification of amino acid assignment can then follow. In this scenario the presence of a 
tRNA with U-starting anticodon will be harmful: although not able to efficiently read the Y- 
ending codons, it will sufficiently suppress them to create damaging ambiguity in their transla- 
tion. As the proteome evolves and becomes more sophisticated, ambiguity becomes an increas- 
ingly important problem. 
Two distinct biochemical approaches can be envisioned. First, the evolution of a machinery 
for anticodon modification could resolve the translational ambiguity of U-starting anticodons 
for split codon boxes. Second, the molecular solution to this translational ambiguity is to avoid 
the U-starting anticodon and to restrict the anticodons to G-starting and C-starting variants 
(for the split codon boxes). In this second approach, the negative selection on the presence of 
U-starting anticodons in split codon boxes also occurs for the presence of A-ending codons (in 
split codon boxes) [10]. With only G-starting and C-starting anticodons present, the A-ending 
codons cannot be read efficiently, and will become rare in the genome. This is a direct effect of 
the positive selection on reduction of ambiguity: the ability to efficiently read A-ending codons 
was less important than the power to use unambiguous codons. Thus, developing unambigu- 
ous coding came with the cost of the inefficient translation of A-ending codons (in the split 
codon boxes), and therefore negative selection on the presence of these codons in protein- 
encoding sequences.

A key issue for the scenario developed here is to evaluate which of the two above approaches 
is more likely to have occurred. A concern regarding the second scenario is that A-ending 
codons in the split codon boxes remain formally unassigned. This issue is considered below. 
An appealing aspect of the second approach is that it negates the need for additional compo- 
nents in the translational system that would be needed to achieve suitable anticodon modifica- 
tion, and that it builds on the striking property of entirely unmodified anticodons to translate 
all 20 amino acids while reading 55 of the 61 sense codons. We prefer the second biochemical 
approach because evolution of a machinery for anticodon modification is, in our view, a phe- 
nomenon which belongs to a later stage of evolution in which a larger genome and a more 
sophisticated enzyme collection are present. 
A recurring line of thought in published work on the evolution of the SGC is that the pres- 
ence of formally unassigned codons is extremely damaging to the organism [8, 29–32]. In this 
argument these codons are essentially untranslatable, and when unavoidable random muta- 
tions result in the introduction of these codons, they function as nonsense mutations. Experi- 
mental evidence in present-day organisms has demonstrated that the presence of formally 
unassigned codons even in essential genes can leave cells viable through the process of suppres- 
sion. We proposed that such suppression would also reduce the damaging nature of the above 
nonsense mutations. This consideration argues in favor of scenarios for the evolution of the 
SGC in which the occurrence of formally unassigned codons is allowed. An alternative scenario 
in which not C-starting anticodons but U-starting anticodons occur offers the advantage that 
the A-ending codons are formally assigned. However, this approach comes at the cost of the 
ambiguous translation of Y-ending codons through suppression of unmodified U-starting anti- 
codons. In our assessment, the fitness cost to an organism of this chronic ambiguous transla- 
tion is higher than the cost of infrequent nonsense mutations to formally unassigned (but 
suppressed) A-ending codons. 
A possible concern regarding the scenario proposed here is that in contemporary tRNA sets 
currently no organisms are known that use C-starting anticodons while not having U-starting 
anticodons (and therefore not using A-ending codons with substantial frequencies). However, 
the evolutionary events considered here are of extremely ancient character (pre-LUCA). As a 
result, it appears entirely plausible that the rarity of A-ending codons in split codon boxes of 
the earlier tRNA set proposed can have been erased in present-day organisms. Please note that 
AGA codons in fact are rare in bacteria (see e.g. [33]. Another aspect of the unassigned A-end- 
ing codons in split codon boxes is that it is possible that they did not go down in numbers, but 
that they had never been present in any large numbers in the earlier phases of genetic code evo- 
lution. The number of codons in frequent use can have been steadily growing during the evolu- 
tionary development of the code. The A-ending codons in split codon boxes might simply not 
have been assigned yet when C-starting anticodons started to assign G-ending codons in split 
codon boxes. The viewpoint that “as soon as a small set of amino acids started to be encoded 
by tRNAs, rapid tRNA gene duplication and mutation of the anticodon resulted in a situation 
in which all codons were assigned to this initial set of amino acids” is not unchallenged (see 
[10]). A much more gradual growth of the number of assigned codons, without much of the 
damaging reassignment, is a bona fide alternative for the view of rapid assignment of all codons 
in the code table (which mainly goes back to Crick [8] and Jukes [34]). 
Interesting in connection to our proposal of primordial rarity of A-ending codons in split 
codon boxes is the work of Trifonov (e.g. [35]) about triplet expansion diseases. Simple 
sequence repeats, of which the triplet repeats are an example, are known in both vertebrates 
and bacteria. “It is generally assumed that during transcription, transient pausing of the RNA 
polymerase complex promotes backward slippage and leads to resynthesis of the same RNA 
sequence” [36]. Trifonov proposes that this phenomenon connected to RNA production is

much more general (than only being present in bacterial immune-escape and in vertebrate 
expansion disease) and was particularly abundantly present during the very first stages of 
genetic code development. In his view Gly and Ala would be the sole amino acids in use in very 
early life, GCC and GGC codons would be the codons for these amino acids, and triplet expan- 
sion (GCC being one of the codons known for triplet expansion, and GGC being its comple- 
mentary codon) would lead to longer RNAs. A consequence of such a start of genetic code 
development is a high abundance of G-starting codons and a low abundance of A-ending 
codons as an original characteristic of protein coding sequences. Trifonov is not the first nor 
the only one to suggest primordial GNN richness of protein coding sequences, cf. [37,38] and 
references in [38]. 
Taken together, the arguments that we present above argue that the cost of leaving codons 
formally unassigned is likely to be much smaller than is generally assumed. And, secondly, that 
(as we propose) the costs of devoting precious genome space to additional components needed 
for anticodon modifications at early stages of the evolution of the genetic code is much higher 
than is often assumed. This assessment of the costs and benefits of the two scenarios is distinct 
from most published work in the area of the evolution of the genetic code. These consider- 
ations lead us to conclude that the second scenario, in which the U-starting anticodons are 
avoided in split codon boxes, should be considered the preferable one. 
The above considerations indicate that subtle differences in the stability of codon-anticodon 
complexes between those of the fourfold degenerate codon boxes and those of the split codon 
boxes and the inability of U-starting anticodons in split codon boxes to perform an efficient 
fourfold degenerate wobble had crucial consequences for developing evolutionary stable tRNA 
sets during the early evolution of the genetic code. This view of the evolutionary development 
of tRNA sets and the susceptibility of tRNA sets by novel tRNAs created through point muta- 
tions in the anticodon is an application of the concept of an evolutionary stable strategy [39– 
42] to tRNA sets during the evolution of the SGC. A consequence of this effect is that all 4 
codons in the UCN codon box were translated by a single tRNA containing a UGA anticodon. 
A corresponding line of reasoning applies to the other seven fourfold degenerate codon boxes. 
In contrast, the UUN codon box was translated by two different tRNAs containing CAA and 
GAA anticodons. As a result of the inability to perform an efficient fourfold wobble, UAA was 
not evolutionarily stable as a Leu anticodon while CAA was stable as a Leu anticodon. This 
argument also applies to the other seven split codon boxes. These considerations provide the 
first evolutionary explanation for the fundamental structure of the genetic code (8 fourfold 
degenerate codon boxes and 8 split codon boxes in an extremely regular distribution). Leh- 
mann and Libchaber already pointed out that: “The basic assumption on which the model is 
built is that wobbling was initially maximized” [11]. That brief statement is in line with the sce- 
nario presented here, but does not address why unmodified U-starting anticodons in the split 
codon boxes were problematic during the early evolution of the code, or what the role of the 
error catastrophe, the proteomic constraint, and suppression were in this process. 
The consequences of the scenario proposed above are that 8 G-starting anticodons (GAA 
reading UUY, GUA reading UAY, GCA reading UGY, GUG reading CAY, GAU reading 
AUY, GUU reading AAY, GCU reading AGY, and GUC reading GAY), 8 U-starting antico- 
dons (UGA reading UCN, UAG reading CUN, UGG reading CCN, UCG reading CGN, UGU 
reading CAN, UAC reading GUN, UGC reading GCN, and UCC reading GGN) and 7 C-start- 
ing anticodons (CAA reading UUG, CCA reading UGG, CUG reading CAG, CAU reading 
AUG, CUU reading AAG, CCU reading AGG, and CUC reading GAG) can achieve a system 
encoding 20 different amino acids while reading 55 of the 61 sense codons of the SGC [10]. 
This set of 23 tRNAs in total is able to operate in the absence of any anticodon modifications. 
Note that according to this viewpoint both Trp and Met have always been coded by one codon

(until the advent of recent code variants) and that the third Ile codon (AUA) is a comparatively 
recent acquisition of Ile (by convergent evolution in archaea and bacteria). The fact that the 
AUA codon was captured by Ile in both domains points to primordial suppression of AUA 
codons by the anticodon GAU, leading to non-canonical Ile-coding in the primordial genome 
by AUA at a low frequency. This conclusion is reminiscent of the finding that some modern 
codon reassignments such as “UGA becomes Trp” and “UAR becomes Gln” are also known to 
have occurred repeatedly, pointing to the occurrence of suppression before the reassignment 
event, therefore directing the choice of the reassignment i.e. which reassignment will be posi- 
tively selected. Evidence in support of such A-ending codon suppression by G-starting antico- 
dons in present-day organisms has been reported [14]. The emergence of a release factor 
recognizing UGA was the circumstance responsible for the fact that Trp did not grow from one 
to two codons during subsequent developments of tRNA sets and anticodon modifications. 
However, we know this reassignment from modern genetic code variants, and in these reas- 
signments first the release factor must disappear. The primordial suppression of AUA codons 
by anticodon GAU was the circumstance responsible for the fact that Met did not grow from 
one to two codons. We propose that Gln, Lys, Glu, Leu (coded by UUG), and Arg (coded by 
AGG) did grow from one to two codons, and that the codon recognition characteristics of C- 
starting anticodons enabled early developing life to liberate itself of ambiguousness in coded 
oligopeptide synthesis. 
The situation of 23 tRNAs described in the paragraph above forms the starting point of 
stage 2 (introduced above) of the evolution of the SGC. In the highly sophisticated biochemistry 
of present-day organisms, anticodon modifications provide a range of subtle advantages. How- 
ever, in the much less sophisticated early genetic code world, tRNA anticodon modifications 
would be required only to translate the following 6 codons: AUA, AGA, UUA, CAA, AAA, and 
GAA. Below we use a comparative genomics approach to determine which of the tRNA modifi- 
cations required for translating these 6 codons were already present in LUCA, and which tRNA 
modifications evolved post-LUCA. Subsequently, we consider the tRNA set of LUCA. 
Unraveling the final steps in the evolution of the SGC based on diversity 
in anticodon modification systems 
Archaea and Bacteria separately evolved the ability to unambiguously recognize the AUA 
codon [10]. The use of lysidine at the wobble position by Bacteria has long been known [43]. 
The use of agmatidine, a chemically different modification, by Archaea was reported much 
more recently [44]. The two modification enzymes involved are quite distinct [45]. Subsequent 
experimental biochemical work confirmed the convergent evolution of the translational read- 
out of AUA as an Ile codon [46,47]. Having recognized the manner in which AUA entered the 
genetic code, we now ask the question: what was the process through which the remaining 5 
sense codons (AGA, UUA, CAA, AAA, and GAA) were included in the genetic code? In the 
case of AGA we found that present data did not allow us to draw a firm conclusion. In bacteria, 
AGA is a rare codon (see e.g. [33]). In archaea, AGA codons are not rare (see e.g. [48]), but it is 
not known at this moment which modification of the UCU anticodon in archaea is responsible 
for preventing suppression of AGY codons. We are forced to leave this as an open question: it 
is unclear if AGA was already used in LUCA. In the case of UUA, CAA, AAA, and GAA we 
were able to derive specific conclusions. For each of these codons we will consider if the modifi- 
cation of the anticodon of the tRNA required for their readout developed independently in 
Archaea and Bacteria, or if the readout of these codons was already optimized in LUCA. 
UUA. Grosjean and co-workers [27] have drawn attention to the fact that methylation of 
the ribose part of U34 of anticodon UAA is found in all three domains. This chemically simple

modification (a single methylation) probably allows the use of A-ending codons (UUA codons 
in this case) without concomitantly producing unacceptable suppression of Y-ending codons. 
Later additional modifications fine-tuned translation, and produced a complicated situation, 
and these modifications are different for different taxonomic groups (see [27]: “The efficacy of 
U34:G3 wobbling will strongly depend on the presence of chemical adducts on the C5 atom of 
U34 [...]. Because these enzymatic modifications of U34 in naturally occurring tRNAs differ in 
the three biological kingdoms...”; also see [49]). However, the first step was comparatively 
simple. Our proposal is that this methylation step allowed the C-starting anticodon CAA to be 
replaced by the U-starting anticodon UAA, and the UUA codon to become a regular sense 
codon instead of a rare sense codon. 
The fact that the SPOUT methyltransferase TrmL (previously named YibK), which in E. coli 
is responsible for this ribose methylation, is one of the smallest SPOUT enzymes known [50], 
supports the concept that this is an enzyme that was already present in LUCA. Very small 
enzymes are good candidates to be very old enzymes. This argument is related to the concept 
of urzymes of Carter and co-workers [51], which have a size of less than 150 amino acid resi- 
dues. Besides Um (the methylation of the ribose part of U) other modifications of U are 
known, like mnm5U, mcm5U, and mcmo5U, but these are complex, produced by sets of larger 
enzymes, and not universal (see e.g. [27], especially Fig 1C), and therefore are, in our opinion, 
unlikely to have been present in LUCA (see also [27]). 
CAA, AAA, and GAA. These three codons share the characteristic that their middle 
nucleotide is A. The fourth A-ending codon with a middle-A (UAA) is a stop codon in the 
SGC. In present-day organisms the recognition of this A-ending codon as “stop” without the 
problem of suppression of the Y-ending codons is achieved through a release factor protein. 
An analysis of the emergence of release factors in LUCA and how these factors evolved in the 
three domains of life following the approach presented here for the evolution of anticodon 
modifications appears possible, but is outside the scope of this article. The three codons CAA, 
AAA, and GAA are discussed as a group because the evolution of a single anticodon modifica- 
tion enzyme (which recognizes middle-A anticodons, but does not distinguish CAA, AAA, and 
GAA) was able to solve the suppression problems associated with the use of these A-ending 
codons. 
Present-day organisms use the 2-thio-modification of U in the first anticodon position 
(U34) to unambiguously read R-ending codons in the middle-A column (see e.g. [52]). Further 
modification of this residue differs among the three domains (see e.g. [27]), but the use of 
2-thio-U is universal. Although the enzymatic route to deliver sulfur differs among different 
taxonomic groups (see [53] and references therein), the final enzyme thiouridylating the first 
nucleotide of the UUG, UUU, and UUC anticodons is always an enzyme which first activates 
the U by adenylation, and then thiolates the residue (see e.g. [52]). In the archaeon Methano- 
coccus maripaludis, the 2-thiouridylase has been found to be not orthologous to MnmA, the 
Escherichia coli enzyme, but to be a paralogue, more related to the 2-thiouridylases which mod- 
ify e.g. C32 instead of U34 [54]. It is important to keep in mind that sulfur assimilation has 
undergone an enormous upheaval since the times of LUCA. While current aerobic organisms 
use sulfate as the sulfur source of sulfur assimilation, in LUCA’s time sulfate was not present 
due to the (largely) anaerobic circumstances. Therefore, the sulfur relay systems in organisms 
like E. coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae likely were not present during LUCA’s time. Cysteine 
was not the intracellular sulfur source: cytoplasmic Cys levels were very low, and Cys-tRNACys 
was likely produced from phosphoseryl-tRNACys [55]. Rauch et al. [56] have argued that 
homocysteine biosynthesis was used to assimilate sulfur (from sulfide), and Met and Cys 
derived their sulfur atoms through that pathway. This argument provides a compelling expla- 
nation for the pervasive differences in the enzymes in sulfur metabolism in different taxonomic

groups [56]. Nevertheless, the use of the 2-thio-modification in the first position of the U-start- 
ing anticodons of tRNAGlu, tRNALys and tRNAGln is universal. 
The universal presence of the 2-thio-modification in U-starting anticodons reading R-end- 
ing middle-A sense codons together with the relative chemical simplicity of this modification 
argues that LUCA already contained 2-thio-U. The relative simplicity of this modification has 
also been invoked in literature on the role of this modification in the early RNA world (see e.g. 
[57]). Starting from the view that originally unmodified C-starting anticodons were used to 
read the G-ending middle-A codons, and taking into consideration that the 2-thio-uridylation 
is universal, we conclude that in the tRNA set of LUCA the CUG, CUU, and CUC anticodons 
were already replaced with UUG, UUU, and UUC anticodons that were 2-thio-uridylated at 
their first nucleotide. The readout of CAR, AAR, and GAR codons was therefore already largely 
optimized in LUCA. 
At this point we warn against a static view in which certain anticodons are always constitu- 
tively modified in the same manner. An important example is that the 2-thio modification in S. 
cerevisiae is associated with specific patterns of gene expression. Laxman et al. [58] point out 
that genes highly enriched for the codons AAR, GAR, and CAR are substantially overrepre- 
sented in rRNA processing, ribosomal subunit biogenesis and other translation-/growth-spe- 
cific biological processes. Absence of the 2-thio modification of the anticodons UUU, UUC, 
and UUG leads to slower translation of mRNAs containing a higher amount of AAR, GAR, 
and CAR codons, and thus comparatively less translation of the proteins involved in rRNA 
processing, ribosomal subunit biogenesis and other translation/growth-specific processes. This 
mechanism results in a controlled reduction in growth rate as the cell faces sulfur scarcity. 
Please note that in S. cerevisiae the UUU, UUC, and UUG anticodons are hypermodified, and 
the ability to read G-ending codons by U-starting anticodons (without concomitant suppres- 
sion of Y-ending codons) is not solely depending on the 2-thio modification. However, these 
further modifications are not universal for the three domains of life [27]. The key finding of 
Laxman and co-workers is that during limitation of Cys and Met, tRNA thiolation is downre- 
gulated. Thus, anticodon modification dynamics play a regulatory role in shifts in the proteome 
via differences in translation speed of mRNAs, due to different codon composition of protein- 
encoding genes. 
In addition to the fundamental importance in evolutionary biochemistry of this new view of 
tRNA anticodon modification, this dynamic view of cellular tRNA modification status is prov- 
ing to be of substantial medical importance, including cancer and mitochondrial stress (see e.g. 
[59–65]). It remains to be investigated if the use of the 2-thio-U modification in gene expres- 
sion regulation is a more recent phenomenon and specific to Opisthokont (i.e. fungal and ani- 
mal) cell biology, or if it is a more ancient aspect of life. The use of the elements S, O, and N in 
signaling (see e.g. [66]), and the use of tRNA anticodon modifications in regulation (see e.g. 
[67]) are exciting developments in evolutionary biochemistry, and it remains to be determined 
whether these processes are ancient and universal or comparatively recent and taxon specific. 
Having examined the anticodons of the tRNAs reading the codons AUA, AGA, UUA, 
CAA, AAA, and GAA in LUCA, we next consider the entire tRNA set of LUCA. 
The tRNA set of LUCA and its anticodon modifications 
In the following paragraphs, we examine the development of the tRNA set of the living cell. 
The approach followed here considers the biochemical and evolutionary interplay between the 
tRNA set of an organism and its set of anticodon modification enzymes. This process is remi- 
niscent of the interplay between the evolving tRNA set of an organism and the set of amino 
acids that it can translate [68,69]. We envision the evolutionary history to have started with a

single tRNA (Fig 2) encoding a single amino acid (tentatively selected as Gly), and to have 
grown by duplications and diversifications of tRNA genes towards the modern tRNA sets of 
Bacteria, Archaea, and Eucarya. Below we propose three distinct steps during stage 2 of the 
evolution of the SGC. 
As a basis for the scenario of the development of the tRNA set during stage 2 of the evolution 
of the genetic code, we now consider which key aspects of tRNA sets are universally conserved in 
all present-day organisms, and which aspects are domain-specific. First, we focus on a feature 
that is universally conserved in all three domains: tRNAs with G-starting anticodons in four- 
fold degenerate codon boxes. It appears that as genome size was increasing, it became advanta- 
geous to have an additional tRNA in the fourfold degenerate codon boxes, taking over the main 
part of decoding of the Y-ending codons. While in some bacteria with smaller genomes these 
tRNAs with G-starting anticodons in the fourfold degenerate codon boxes are sometimes absent 
[14], they are a part of the tRNA sets of most organisms in all three domains (although the G- 
starting anticodon often has turned into a I-starting anticodon in Eucarya). We conclude that the 
feature of having at least two tRNAs in each codon box (except the UAN codon box with two 
stop codons) was already present in LUCA. The degree of resemblance of the tRNA sets of the 
three domains is too high to make convergent evolution an acceptable alternative. 
Another aspect that is found in all three domains is: tRNAs with C-starting anticodons in 
addition to tRNAs with U-starting anticodons. In the same way that the U-starting tRNA in 
a fourfold degenerate codon box is assisted by a tRNA with a G-starting anticodon, tRNAs 
with U-starting anticodons are assisted by a tRNA with a C-starting anticodon to obtain better 
reading of the G-ending codon. The feature of having both a C-starting anticodon and a U- 
starting anticodon working on the R-ending codons (except in the UAA codon box, the UGA 
codon box, and the AUA codon box, where stop and start signals complicate the situation) also 
is a universal property of living cells. Again, convergent evolution does not seem the most par- 
simonious hypothesis. 
Third, we consider an aspect which is not found in all three domains: tRNAs with I-start- 
ing anticodons. The base modification inosine is found used in the CGN codon box of bacteria 
(see below). Use of I in the first anticodon position in other codon boxes of bacteria is very 
rare, but its use in the CGN codon box is standard in bacteria. In Eucarya, inosine in the first 
anticodon position is used in many codon boxes. Especially in the fourfold degenerate codon 
boxes it is the most frequently used nucleotide (see e.g. [28]). However, inosine is not a univer- 
sal aspect of life. This base modification is absent from Archaea. We propose that the most par- 
simonious explanation is that LUCA did not have inosine, that Archaea never acquired 
inosine, that Bacteria evolved inosine, and that Eucarya inherited inosine from Bacteria. 
Another aspect that is also not found in all three domains is: tRNAs with xo5U-starting 
anticodons. This modification, which enlarges rather than restricts the base pairing character- 
istics of U-starting anticodons, is exclusively bacterial. While some anticodon modifications 
are universal characteristics of living cells (e.g. the use of the Um modification enabling UUA

recognition without suppression of UUY, or the use of the thio-modification enabling CAA, 
AAA, and GAA recognition without suppression of CAY, AAY, and GAY), other anticodon 
modification uses are domain-specific characteristics (e.g. abundant use of I-starting antico- 
dons in Eucarya and use of xo5U-starting anticodons in Bacteria). 
Taking into account the above four points, we propose that the set of 23 tRNAs lacking anti- 
codon modifications (Fig 3) evolved into a stage in which the cell had a tRNA set containing 32 
anticodons. As described below, the set of 23 tRNAs [10] can be elegantly enlarged to this 32 
tRNA set when the system has grown in sophistication, and the cellular machinery can support 
a substantially larger genome size. 
This 32 tRNA set is essentially the tRNA set with G-starting anticodons for the Y-ending 
codons and U-starting anticodons for the R-ending codons. Because of initiation and termina- 
tion of translation, three split codon boxes do not have a U-starting anticodon: UAN, UGN, 
and AUN (as stated above, we leave the question open if AGG was read by a CCU or a UCU 
anticodon in this stage). In the UAN codon box, the UAR codons are stop codons. Therefore, a 
single (G-starting) anticodon suffices to recognize the sense codons of the UAN codon box. In 
the UGN codon box, the UGA codon is a stop codon. Therefore, not a U-starting anticodon 
but a C-starting anticodon translates the G-ending codon in this codon box. Two anticodons 
are thus present in this codon box: a G-starting anticodon for the Y-ending codons and a C- 
starting anticodon for the UGG codon. In the AUN codon box, AUG has become the start 
codon. Three anticodons are therefore present in this codon box: a G-starting anticodon for 
the Y-ending codons, a C-starting anticodon for the AUG codon playing a role during transla- 
tion initiation (see below), and a second C-starting anticodon for AUG codons specifying 
methionine during translation elongation. Please note that in the 32 tRNA stage of the genetic 
code no anticodon is able to read the AUA codon efficiently and unambiguously. In summary, 
the UAN, UGN, and AUN codon boxes have on average two anticodons per codon box, just as 
the remaining 13 codon boxes. Therefore, a set of 32 tRNAs (see Fig 4) is involved in more 
sophisticated translation (with anticodon modifications playing a role in the UUN, CAN, 
AAN, and GAN codon boxes) when compared to the 23 tRNA set discussed above. It is a 
tRNA set which has clearly progressed from the situation where limits of genomic memory

space enforced superwobbling in fourfold degenerate codon boxes through a set of 23 tRNAs 
with unmodified anticodons. The first distinct step during stage 2 of the evolution of the SGC 
is the growth of the tRNA set from 23 tRNAs to 32 tRNAs. 
As a next step, we propose a stage in which the cell had a tRNA set containing 44 or 45 antico- 
dons. We expect the following set of tRNAs to have been present in LUCA (Fig 5). For the eight 
fourfold degenerate codon boxes, we expect 3 tRNAs for each codon box (one with a G-starting 
anticodon, one with a U-starting anticodon, and one with a C-starting anticodon), which adds up 
to 24 tRNAs. For the five split codon boxes with 2 amino acids in the codon box, each encoded by 
two codons, we expect also 3 tRNAs for each codon box (one with a G-starting anticodon for the 
first amino acid, and for the second amino acid two tRNAs: one with a C-starting anticodon and 
one with an U-starting anticodon, the last one likely requiring anticodon modification to prevent 
misreading of the Y-ending codons). This adds up to 14 or 15 tRNAs (depending upon the open 
question if a tRNA with an UCU anticodon was present in this stage). For the two split codon 
boxes with 2 amino acids coded in the codon box, of which the second amino acid is encoded by 
just one G-ending codon, we expect 2 tRNAs (one with a G-starting anticodon for the first amino 
acid and one with a C-starting anticodon for the second amino acid). This adds up to 4 tRNAs. 
For the UAN codon box, we expect 1 tRNA (with a G-starting anticodon, the other two codons 
are recognized by a release factor protein). Finally, because the specialized initiator tRNA is uni- 
versal (see e.g. [70]), we expect that one (with a C-starting anticodon) also. This makes a grand 
totalof24+14or15+4+1+1=44or45.Thisseconddistinctstepduringstage2oftheevolu- 
tion of the SGC is the growth of the tRNA set from 32 tRNAs to 44 or 45 tRNAs. 
The difference between this proposed tRNA set of LUCA (Fig 5) and the one of present-day 
Archaea (Fig 6) is the presence of the second tRNAIle with an agmatidine-modified CAU anti- 
codon in the latter. The third distinct step during stage 2 of the evolution of the SGC as men- 
tioned above is the growth of the tRNA set to include a tRNA which can recognize the AUA 
codon. This third step is a post-LUCA development, and here we see convergent evolution in 
archaea and bacteria to obtain the capability of using AUA. This evolutionary challenge was 
solved in molecularly different ways (see [10, 44–47]).

question (see above). It is a possibility that LUCA was an organism which was significantly 
more complex than the organism with the 44 or 45 tRNAs, that the 44 or 45 tRNA stage was 
the one of a progenitor of LUCA, and that, after the more complex LUCA stage, streamlining 
the system did lead to a more simple tRNA set as found in Archaea. However, we consider the

should be seen as a modification of A, because it emerges in nucleic acid strands as a result of 
enzymatic deamination of A. Archaea do not use inosine, while Bacteria only use it in three 
codon boxes: CGN and (only very rarely) CUN and ACN [27]. But, characteristic for Bacteria, 
a specific modification of U (xo5U34) is used for many tRNAs [71]. Importantly, these specific 
modification systems (A-deamination in Eucarya and a specific U-modification in Bacteria) 
leave a characteristic “fingerprint” in the codon usage of Eucarya and Bacteria [71]. Based on 
the comparatively restricted set of anticodon modification enzymes in Archaea and the result- 
ing archaeal codon usage, we follow the authors of [71] in proposing that the situation in 
Archaea can be considered as the primordial situation (both in tRNA set and codon usage), 
from which Bacteria and Eucarya have diverged. While the A-deamination modification 
enzymes of Eucarya and the specific U-modification enzymes of Bacteria have strongly affected 
their codon usage, the codon usage of the Archaea has coevolved with a much more restricted 
modification pattern [71]. Woese’s three domains can thus be recognized in the codon usage of 
the three different kinds of cellular organisms, as demonstrated in [71]. Considering the pri- 
mordial situation found in Archaea with respect to both tRNA set and codon usage, the pri- 
mordial character implied by the name Archaea turns out to be very appropriate. 
Elaborating on the notion that the tRNA set of present-day Archaea resembles the ancestral 
situation, Novoa et al. [71] refer to Methanococcus-like Archaea and describe that the tRNA 
set of this group of archaea is smaller than those of Non-Methanococcus-like Archaea. This 
observation led them to propose that the tRNA set in Methanococcus-like Archaea resembles 
the ancestral tRNA set. However, more sophisticated analysis (including the use of large data 
sets of concatenated sequences of informational proteins combined with the use of procedures 
to remove proteins that have been affected by lateral gene transfer) has indicated that these 
small-genome Archaea contain a reduced tRNA set derived from a relatively recent Archaeal 
ancestor (see e.g. [72,73]). This analysis establishes that the Non-Methanococcus-like tRNA set 
is the primordial one, while the (smaller) Methanococcus-like tRNA set is a derived one. 
Therefore, the 32 tRNA set presented above (which resembles the Methanococcus-like tRNA 
set) was the tRNA set of an ancestor of LUCA, just as the 23 tRNA set discussed earlier. Except 
for the G-ending codons in the UAN, UGN, and AUN codon boxes, all the G-ending codons 
(with the possible exception of AGG) in the primordial, Non-Methanococcus-like tRNA set 
stage were translated by a dedicated C-starting anticodon tRNA to assist a tRNA with an U- 
starting anticodon with the recognition of the G-ending codons (see e.g. [27]), because those 
codons were always less efficiently recognized by the U-starting anticodons (either modified or 
unmodified) than the A-ending codons. In some Archaeal lineages, a reduction in the number 
of tRNA genes occurred compared to the situation in LUCA. This process resembles the well- 
established case of the reduced tRNA set in mitochondria. 
Nelson-Sathi and co-workers [74] recently reported that massive Bacteria-to-Archaea lat- 
eral gene transfer events are at the root of more than 10 major taxa within the Archaea. This 
finding implies that it is difficult to derive the genome of the “primordial archaeon”, and has 
the potential to complicate the proposal that the Archaeal tRNA set resembles the primordial 
tRNA set in LUCA. However, despite this massive gene transfer, the Archaea have retained 
their distinct character with respect to their tRNA set and codon usage. The laterally trans- 
ferred bacterial genes, which allowed the archaeon in which they were incorporated to conquer 
a new ecological niche, subsequently adjusted their codon usage to the archaeal system. This 
consideration indicates that the tRNA set is one of the most stable characteristics of a cell. 
Novoa and co-workers [71] already reached this conclusion with respect to individual tRNA 
genes: the sequences can undergo lateral gene transfer, but the functions (having a tRNA with a 
specific anticodon delivering a specific amino acid) needed to be continuously fulfilled. This 
stability of function is also relevant for the U-thiolation (see above) necessary for unambiguous

codon reading in the CAN, AAN, and GAN codon boxes: not the gene for the enzyme is con- 
tinuously present, but a gene for a U-thiolation enzyme. Vetsigian and co-workers [75] already 
placed emphasis on the need during the development of the genetic code for an “innovation- 
sharing protocol” to be able to incorporate foreign DNA to re-gain functions lost due to muta- 
tion, and to gain new functions needed for survival in an innovation-developing competitive 
environment. Considering the results of Nelson-Sathi et al., [74], the Archaea appear to have 
retained this genomic flexibility to a greater extent than the Bacteria and the Eucarya. 
Previous published work [76] is relevant to the resemblance of the tRNA set of archaea to 
that of the LUCA discussed here. In a study of tRNA paralogs, Xue and co-workers showed 
that archaeal tRNAs are less divergent than others. However, the conclusions drawn from this 
observation have attracted substantial debate, see e.g. [77–79]. For the arguments against 
Methanopyrus kandleri being an organism which is primitive compared to other archaea, see 
[72]. For the arguments that small genome and small tRNA set archaea are generally organisms 
with a reduced genome rather than primitive organisms, see [73]. While one has to be 
extremely careful in interpreting evolution concerning archaea with reduced genomes, the fact 
that archaea in general have slowly evolving tRNAs is emerging as an important conclusion. 
Different views on evolution of the tRNA sets in the three domains have been proposed. 
One view is that the set of 20 amino acids evolved independently in the three domains in a con- 
vergent manner [27]. The diversity of the tRNA anticodon modifications found among living 
cells has been brought forward as support for this view. Another view is that LUCA already func- 
tioned with the canonical set of 20 amino acids (as is argued here). The latter view is supported 
by the fact that no modifications are necessary to unambiguously read 55 of the 61 sense codons 
while encoding all 20 canonical amino acids. Based on the work of Lehmann and Libchaber [11], 
the conclusion can be drawn that 8 tRNAs with unmodified U-starting anticodons suffice to read 
32 of the sense codons. To have unambiguous coding in the remaining codon boxes, the exclusive 
use of tRNAs with unmodified G-starting anticodons and unmodified C-starting anticodons 
(simply behaving according to the wobble rules as proposed by Crick [21]) suffices. The actual 
amino acid assignments in the standard genetic code allow such a mechanism to provide rela- 
tively efficient and relatively unambiguous encoding of all 20 amino acids. 
The fact that the comparatively simple tRNA set of the Archaea is closer to this proposed 
ancestral situation than the comparatively more derived and complex tRNA sets (especially 
concerning their anticodon modification patterns) of Bacteria and Eucarya supports this view. 
Based on the fundamental behavior of unmodified anticodon function as presented in [21] and 
[11], we thus conclude that the tRNA set of the Archaea is closer to the primordial tRNA set. 
In addition, we argue that the modification enzyme thiouridylase predates LUCA (providing 
translation of 3 of the missing codons: CAA, AAA, and GAA, without introducing ambiguity 
by misreading of Y-ending codons). We expect that LUCA also already used the methylation 
of the ribose part of U34 of anticodon UAA, which enabled the use of UUA. As presented in 
recent literature [10,46,47], accurate AUA decoding is a convergent development in Archaea 
and Bacteria. We leave the usage of the AGA codon in LUCA as an open question. We con- 
clude that except for AUA (and possibly AGA) LUCA already used all sense codons, and was 
able to do so using only two (or possibly three) relatively simple anticodon modifications. 
The analysis presented here reveals that the second stage of genetic code development 
(acquiring the ability to recognize all 61 sense codons quickly and unambiguously) was nearly 
complete in LUCA. Only one or two sense codons were outside LUCA’s sense codon reper- 
toire. In summary, this paper contains two main messages. Firstly, the importance of the 
extremely regular structure of the genetic code for understanding the evolution of life is 
brought into focus. Secondly, LUCA greatly resembled present-day Archaea in terms of its 
tRNA set, while Bacteria and Eucarya have diverged from this situation.
