Archaeal ancestors of eukaryotes: not so 
elusive any more 
Eugene V. Koonin 
Abstract 
The origin of eukaryotes is one of the hardest 
problems in evolutionary biology and sometimes 
raises the ominous specter of irreducible complexity. 
Reconstruction of the gene repertoire of the last 
eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) has revealed a 
highly complex organism with a variety of advanced 
features but no detectable evolutionary intermediates 
to explain their origin. Recently, however, genome 
analysis of diverse archaea led to the discovery of 
apparent ancestral versions of several signature 
eukaryotic systems, such as the actin cytoskeleton and 
the ubiquitin network, that are scattered among 
archaea. These findings inspired the hypothesis that 
the archaeal ancestor of eukaryotes was an unusually 
complex form with an elaborate intracellular 
organization. The latest striking discovery made by 
deep metagenomic sequencing vindicates this 
hypothesis by showing that in phylogenetic trees 
eukaryotes fall within a newly identified archaeal 
group, the Lokiarchaeota, which combine several 
eukaryotic signatures previously identified in different 
archaea. The discovery of complex archaea that are 
the closest living relatives of eukaryotes is most 
compatible with the symbiogenetic scenario for 
eukaryogenesis. 
A recent discovery enabled by single-cell genomics tech- 
nology seems to be a huge step towards understanding 
the origin of eukaryotes [1, 2]. To explain why this ap- 
pears to be the case, I discuss here the formidable diffi- 
culty of the problem, the previous salient observations 
and the proposed solutions. 
A eukaryotic cell is a strikingly complex macromolecular 
aggregate by any account, but specifically when compared

with archaeal and bacterial cells. To begin with, a typical 
eukaryotic cell has a three to four orders of magnitude 
larger volume than most bacteria and archaea [3–5]. This 
size difference translates into a difference in the physical 
principles of cell functioning: unlike most bacteria and 
archaea in which proteins, nucleic acids and small mole- 
cules diffuse more or less freely, the intracellular space in 
eukaryotes is fully compartmentalized so that molecules 
are distributed through specialized transport mechanisms 
[6, 7]. The compartmentalization and transport are 
supported by the elaborate system of intracellular mem- 
branes which includes the membrane of the eponymous 
eukaryotic organelle, the nucleus, and by an advanced 
cytoskeleton that consists of actin filaments and tubulin 
microtubules and includes numerous additional, dedicated 
proteins. Crucially, the great majority of eukaryotes pos- 
sess the power-producing organelles, the mitochondria or 
their derivatives, that are now commonly accepted to have 
evolved from α-proteobacteria by endosymbiosis [8, 9]. 
Although some unicellular eukaryotes lack mitochondria, 
evolutionary reconstructions clearly point to secondary 
loss in all amitochondrial groups [10, 11]. 
Thus, eukaryotes show a qualitatively different level of 
cellular organization from that of archaea and bacteria, 
and there are no detectable evolutionary intermediates. 
Comparative analysis of eukaryotic cells and genomes 
indicates that the signature advanced functional systems 
of the eukaryotic cells were already present in the last 
eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA). These ancestral 
features include the actin and tubulin-based forms of 
cytoskeleton, the nuclear pore, the spliceosome, and the 
ubiquitin signaling network, to mention only several 
aspects of the inherent organizational complexity of 
eukaryotic cells [12–16]. The emergence of these funda- 
mental facets of advanced cellular organization presents 
a challenge of such scale that Darwin’s famous scenario 
for the evolution of the eye looks like a straightforward 
solution to an easy problem. To some, the enigma of 
eukaryogenesis can appear so perplexing that the infam- 
ous concept of ‘irreducible complexity’ has sneaked into

the scientific mainstream [17], although debunking of 
these ideas has not been long in coming [18]. Below I 
discuss the recent advances in evolutionary genomics 
that make the origin of eukaryotes much less mysterious 
than it appeared even recently. 
Phylogenetic position of the eukaryotes: sister 
group to archaea? 
Molecular phylogenetics and phylogenomics offer a com- 
plementary perspective on the origin of eukaryotes. The 
standard ‘tree of life’, based initially on the sequences of 
16S rRNA and subsequently on the sequences of other 
universal genes, such as protein components of the trans- 
lation and transcription systems, unequivocally identifies 
the ancestry of the information-processing systems of 
eukaryotes as archaeal. The early versions of the tree in 
the standard textbooks had eukaryotes as the sister group 
of archaea, to the exclusion of bacteria [19–22]. However, 
an alternative phylogenetic method applied to the same 
16S rRNAs has suggested a different, so-called eocyte tree 
topology [23, 24] (Fig. 1). In the eocyte tree, eukaryotes 
formacladewithinthearchaealbranch,asthesistergroup 
to the ‘eocytes’, the archaeal phylum that is currently known 
as Crenarchaeota [23–26]. Subsequent phylogenetic studies 
have reached various conclusions on the relationships be- 
tween eukaryotes and archaea. Depending on the data set 
and the phylogenetic methodology, support has been re- 
ported for the standard placement of eukaryotes as a sister 
group to archaea, the eocyte topology, or various positions 
of the eukaryotes within the phylum Euryarchaeota, which 
includes mostly methanogens and halophiles [27]. Further- 
more, phylogenomic analysis of multiple eukaryotic genes 
of archaeal provenance has pointed to their likely origins 
from different groups of archaea. Such findings seem to be 
most compatible with extensive horizontal gene transfer be- 
tween the major groups of archaea, although artifacts and 
biases, caused in particular by differences in the characteris- 
tic evolutionary rates of these groups, could be responsible 
for some of the observations [28]. 
The uncertainty of the phylogenetic position of eukary- 
otes with respect to the archaea resulted from conflicting 
placements obtained with different methods and datasets 
and even a declaration of a “phylogenomic impasse” [29]. 
Ironically, however, shortly after the impasse was declared, 
progress became apparent due, above all, to the discovery 
of new archaeal phyla such as Korarchaeota [30], Thau- 
marchaeota and Aigarchaeota [31]. The latest, extensive 
metagenomic and single-cell genomics studies have led 
to a veritable ‘bonanza’ of putative new archaeal phyla 
[32–35] (Fig. 2). Several independent phylogenies of 
multiple conserved genes have consistently supported 
the monophyly of a deeply rooted archaeal “TACK” 
superphylum, named after its constituent phyla, Thau- 
marchaeota, Aigarchaeota, Crenarchaeota and Korarch- 
aeota [36–40], and also provisionally designated the 
new kingdom Proteoarchaeota [41, 42]. A subsequent 
comprehensive phylogenetic study has suggested that 
the Proteoarchaeota additionally includes two novel 
phyla, Bathyarchaeota and Geoarchaeota [34] (an alter- 
native analysis has suggested inclusion of Geoarchaeota 
into Crenarchaeota [43]; Fig. 2). 
The discovery of the new archaeal phyla and the puta- 
tive kingdom Proteoarchaeota stimulated renewed phy- 
logenomic effort on elucidation of the archaeal ancestry 
of eukaryotes. Two independent, thorough phylogenetic 
analyses of rRNA and universal protein-coding genes 
demonstrated significant support for the affinity of 
eukaryotes with Proteoarchaeota but not with any spe- 
cific lineage thereof [37, 44, 45], whereas another study 
placed eukaryotes within the Proteoarchaeota, as a sister 
group to Thaumarchaeota [46]. These results suggest an 
exit from the aforementioned impasse by indicating 
that eukaryotes most likely evolved from within the 
archaea, in accord with an ‘extended eocyte hypothesis’ 
[47]. Nevertheless, the conclusions of these phyloge-

sets and methods employed, and arguably fall short of 
conclusively resolving the evolutionary relationship be- 
tween archaea and eukaryotes. 
The chimeric nature of eukaryotic genomes and 
scenarios of eukaryogenesis 
Regardless of the method employed, phylogenomic ana- 
lysis of eukaryotic genes with homologs in bacteria and/or 
archaea reveals a fundamental split into genes of archaeal 
provenance and those of bacterial provenance. The ‘ar- 
chaeal’ class includes primarily genes involved in informa- 
tion transmission whereas the ‘bacterial’ genes represent 
the ‘operational’ category, in particular metabolic enzymes, 
transporters and signal transduction systems. Notably, the 
‘bacterial’ genes outnumber the ‘archaeal’ genes about two- 
fold, indicative of a major contribution of bacteria to the 
genetic composition of eukaryotes [28, 48]. Given the 
apparent rarity of recent acquisitions of bacterial genes by 
eukaryotes, it appears likely that most of that contribution

comes from the massive transfer of the (proto)mitochon- 
drial genes to the nuclear genome, although relatively few 
genes can be traced specifically to α-proteobacteria. How- 
ever, the complexity of the α-proteobacterial pangenome 
has made it impossible to infer the gene complement of 
the proto-mitochondrial endosymbiont with any preci- 
sion, and could account for the apparent heterogeneity of 
the bacterial heritage of eukaryotes [49, 50]. A recent ana- 
lysis of the relative age of the ‘bacterial’ genes in eukaryotes 
using a comprehensive set of genomes and advanced 
comparative-genomic and phylogenetic methods indeed 
suggests that, apart from the chloroplast-derived genes in 
plants and algae, the overwhelming majority of these genes 
have been acquired in a single sweep which is thought to 
be the influx from the primary endosymbiont [51]. 
The preponderance of genes of bacterial origin in 
eukaryotes begs the question: why are eukaryotes usually 
(even in current biology textbooks) viewed as a sister 
group of archaea (or possibly, eocytes) and not of α- 
proteobacteria? I contend that there is indeed no justifica- 
tion for this view, and the only consistent characterization 
of the evolutionary status of eukaryotes is as archaeo- 
bacterial chimeras. That said, not all genes are equal, and 
the archaeal heritage of eukaryotes includes most of the 
genes that are universal to the eukaryotic organisms or to 
all cellular life forms and are highly conserved in sequence 
[51, 52]. This set of (predominantly) informational genes 
reflects the vertical trend in the evolution of life far better 
than any other genes and accordingly is best suitable for 
the construction of the “tree of life” [53]. Nevertheless, the 
history of life is by no account reducible to the phylogeny 
of informational genes [54, 55], for which the chimeric 
origin and composition of the eukaryotic genome is argu- 
ably the best case in point. 
Taking into account the apparent acquisition of the 
endosymbiont prior to LECA, the scenarios of eukaryo- 
genesis split into two groups according to the postulated 
nature of the host [10]. In the first group of hypotheses, 
the host is envisioned as a primitive, amitochondrial, 
unicellular, phagotrophic eukaryote [56, 57]. This hypo- 
thetical ancestral eukaryote is often called archezoan. 
The attractive feature of these hypotheses stems from 
the postulated phagotrophic lifestyle of the archezoa: like 
extant amoeba, the archezoa would routinely engulf 
bacteria one of which would eventually turn into the 
endosymbiont [58, 59]. The problem with the archezoan 
scenarios is twofold. First, and most obviously, no primary 
amitochondrial eukaryotes (would-be archezoa) are known. 
Second, perhaps more controversially, quantitative argu- 
ments have been presented that a cell of typical eukaryotic 
size and complexity is unsustainable without multiple 
power-producing organelles such as the mitochondria. 
The scenarios of the second group are based on the 
postulate that the cell that captured the endosymbiont

other phylogenetic analyses suggesting this [41, 42, 74]. The position of the Lokiarchaeota is from [1]. In addition to the eukaryotes, the Lokiarchaeota 
branch includes three distinct lineages one of which is the sister group to the eukaryotes. The size of the triangles roughly reflects the diversity of the 
respective groups

was a regular archaeon, and endosymbiosis actually trig- 
gered eukaryogenesis, including the emergence of the 
endomembrane system and other signature attributes of 
eukaryotic cells [10, 38, 60]. These symbiogenetic scenar- 
ios do not assume any unknown ancestral cell types, and 
arguably credible causative chains have been proposed for 
the origin of the eukaryotic cellular organization. The weak- 
ness of these scenarios is in the apparent extreme rarity of 
endosymbiosis among bacteria and archaea. 
Could there be a third way that would combine the 
advantages of the two types of scenarios while avoiding 
the drawbacks of each? I address this possibility in the 
discussion that follows. 
The scattered archaeal ‘eukaryome’ and the 
possibility of a complex archaeal ancestor of 
eukaryotes 
Recent analysis of diverse archaeal genomes resulted in a 
series of striking observations. It turns out that the evolu- 
tionary relationship between archaea and eukaryotes is 
not limited to the core of information-processing systems 
but also involves several genes and entire gene suites that 
are essential for eukaryotic intracellular organization [61]. 
Surprisingly, however, these homologs of the signature 
eukaryotic genes are scattered among different archaea. 
Perhaps the most notable case is the ubiquitin system that 
has been identified in the single sequenced genome from 
the new phylum Aigarchaeota, Candidatus Caldiarch- 
aeum subterrenium [31]. Ubiquitin-like proteins and the 
ubiquitin-conjugating machinery have been previously 
identified in other archaea but these were distant homo- 
logs of the respective eukaryotic proteins, so the ancestral 
relationship remained unclear [62, 63]. The case of C. sub- 
terrenium is different. In this genome, the genes for a ubi- 
quitin homolog, ubiquitin ligase and a key deubiquitinase 
form an operon, and most important, in the respective 
phylogenetic trees, these proteins clearly cluster with the 
eukaryotic homologs. Thus, there is little doubt that the 
archaeal ancestry of the ubiquitin systems has been traced. 
Equally consequential is the discovery of archaeal actins 
(dubbed crenactins) that are present in several groups of 
Proteoarchaeota [64] and have been shown to form fila- 
ments resembling the eukaryotic cytoskeleton [65]. Other 
examples of apparent archaeal ancestors of key eukaryotic 
systems involved in the formation of intracellular struc- 
tures are tubulins [66] and the ECSRT-III complex that 
participates in cell division and intracellular membrane 
remodeling [67, 68]. Notably, these signature genes were 
found mostly in different groups of Proteoarchaeota, in ac- 
cord with the latest phylogenomic results discussed above. 
The discovery of this scattered “archaeal eukaryome” 
has prompted the hypothesis of a complex archaeal host 
for the protomitochondrial endosymbiont . Given the ex- 
tensive horizontal gene transfer in archaea combined with 
the observations that most archaeal lineages apparently 
evolved under a streamlining regime [40, 69], it has been 
speculated that this ancestral archaeal form combined, 
within a single genome, various components of the eukar- 
yome that are scattered among the extant archaea. This 
hypothetical organism, although distinctly archaeal, might 
have been capable of a primitive form of phagocytosis 
which would facilitate the capture of the endosymbiont 
[38, 61, 64]. Conceivably, this ancestral archaeon would 
actively acquire genes via horizontal gene transfer, thus 
suggesting an alternative explanation for the different af- 
finities of ‘bacterial’ genes in eukaryotes. 
An unexpected recent discovery made by methods of 
single cell genomics indicates that archaea resembling the 
putative complex ancestors of eukaryotes are not extinct. 
Loki: archaeal ancestor of eukaryotes found alive 
and well? 
Enter Loki. Metagenomic analysis of sea floor sediments 
near a hydrothermal vent site in the Arctic named Loki’s 
Castle has revealed a putative deep archaeal lineage within 
Proteoarchaeota [1, 2]. Being keenly interested in archaea 
that potentially could shed light on the origin of eukary- 
otes, Thijs Ettema and colleagues undertook deep sequen- 
cing of the metagenomic samples from Loki’s Castle and 
succeeded in assembling a nearly complete genome as 
well as several partial genomes from a new archaeal group 
they named Lokiarchaeota (simply Loki, for short). The 
results of the Loki genome analysis exceed the boldest 
expectations. Indeed, Loki combines the two key features 
predicted for the archaeal ancestor of eukaryotes by the 
hypothesis discussed in the preceding section. First, in a 
phylogenetic tree of 36 highly conserved genes encoding 
components of information-processing systems, eukary- 
otes convincingly fall within the Loki branch (Fig. 2). This 
finding settles the issue of the evolutionary relationship 
between eukaryotes and archaea: there is no longer any 
reasonable doubt that the information-processing systems 
of eukaryotes evolved from a specific branch deep within 
the archaeal tree, and now that branch is known. 
Second, and equally important, the genome of Loki 
reveals the assortment of the signature eukaryotic fea- 
tures that has been predicted for the archaeal ancestor 
of eukaryotes [38, 61, 64]. Specifically, Loki encodes 
crenactins, homologs of eukaryotic gelsolins (another 
family of essential cytoskeleton proteins), the ESCRT- 
III complex, an expanded family of small Ras-like 
GTPases and the complete ubiquitin system. This gene 
repertoire translates into a confident prediction of a 
complex cytoskeleton and membrane remodeling sys- 
tems and is compatible with a rudimentary phagocytic 
capability. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis indicates 
that most of these homologs of signature eukaryotic 
Koonin BMC Biology (2015) 13:84

/*** End Page =3= ***/
/*** Page =4= ***/
genes occupy the basal position in the respective trees, 
adding credence to the ancestral relationship [1]. 
Thus, Loki is by far the best current candidate for the 
role of a direct descendant of the archaeal ancestor of 
eukaryotes. It is crucial to emphasize that, all its genomic 
and predicted organizational complexity notwithstanding, 
Loki is a typical archaeon and not the hypothetical arche- 
zoan. Despite the presence of elements of cytoskeleton, key 
features that are readily detectable in any eukaryotic gen- 
ome, such as components of the nuclear pore and the 
spliceosome, as well as spliceosomal introns, are missing, 
and the entire replication machinery as well as the suite of 
membrane biogenesis enzymes all have telltale archaeal 
features [1]. Thus, although the discovery of Loki falls short 
of eliminating the archezoan scenario of eukaryogenesis 
once and for all, it substantially increases the credibility of 
the symbiogenetic scenario. 
Implications and remaining open questions 
The extremely hard problem of eukaryogenesis now ap- 
pears perceptibly more tractable thanks to the advances 
of comparative genomics of archaea and in particular 
the spectacular progress of metagenomics. The path to 
this new understanding was paved by the sequencing of 
many diverse archaeal genomes followed by detailed 
phylogenomic analysis. These efforts produced mounting 
evidence of the evolutionary relationship between Pro- 
teoarchaeota and Eukaryota, and enabled the partial 
reconstruction of the genome of a complex archaeal an- 
cestor of eukaryotes. The discovery of Loki precipitated 
the breakthrough. The origin of eukaryotes from a spe- 
cific group of archaea, lodged deep within the archaeal 
evolutionary tree and specifically within Proteoarchaeota, 
now should be considered an established fact. Moreover, 
we also know that the closest extant archaeal relatives of 
eukaryotes encode a variety of likely ancestors of signature 
eukaryotic genes that contribute to the cytoskeleton and 
other aspects of eukaryotic cellular organization. These 
observations make the symbiogenetic scenario of eukaryo- 
genesis look more credible than it ever did in the past. 
The newly achieved clarity in our understanding of 
these key aspects of eukaryogenesis calls for reassess- 
ment of some of the most general concepts in biology. 
The first one is the representation of the entire history 
of life as a single evolutionary tree, a grand idea that 
goes back to the famous single illustration of Darwin’s 
Origin of Species [70]. The symbiogenetic scenario of 
eukaryogenesis flatly defies this concept because under 
this scenario, a major kingdom of life, the eukaryotes, 
emerged in a non-tree-like manner, through fusion of 
different, distant branches of the tree. The importance of 
trees for understanding the evolution of individual 
genes, gene ensembles and major taxa, especially those 
that encompass multicellular eukaryotes, is undeniable 
[71]. However, the new findings on the origin of eukary- 
otes as well as the origin of archaeal phyla [72] indicate 
that major transitions in evolution often, perhaps typic- 
ally, occur through the fusion of cells and/or genomes of 
distantly related organisms. The second, not unrelated 
general theme is the number and nature of the primary 
domains of life. In the late 1980s, based on the rRNA 
trees, Woese and colleagues developed the three-domain 
scheme (Fig. 1a) [19]. The placement of eukaryotes within 
the archaeal branch that has been clinched by the discov- 
ery of Loki refutes this scheme and shows that the only 
consistent interpretation of the phylogeny of the universal 
(primarily informational) genes involves two primary 
domains: bacteria and archaea (with eukaryotes included) 
(Fig. 1b) [45]. 
Loki is named after the trickster god of Norse myth- 
ology. He is supposed to have a malicious streak about 
him but he is also the harbinger of change [73]. Surely, 
the transition that Loki or his relative seems to have 
brought about, the origin of eukaryotes, was one of the 
most momentous in the history of our planet. 
What next? Does Loki bridge archaea and eukaryotes 
as stated in the title of the article by Ettema and col- 
leagues? I think this is still only a halfway bridge. A lot of 
difficult work remains to be done to join the two banks. 
First, Loki certainly is not the archaeal ancestor of eukary- 
otes: that life form existed over a billion years ago. It is 
entirely possible and actually likely that even closer relatives 
of eukaryotic ancestors may be discovered, perhaps with an 
even greater organizational complexity. Loki is only the 
beginning of the quest for those ancestors, by no means

characterization of archaeal (and bacterial) diversity by 
methods of metagenomics and single cell genomics is 
the easy part of the deal. The challenge lies in the in- 
vestigation of the biology of these organisms. Although 
we can never know what precisely happened more than 
a billion years ago, to me, demonstration of the ar- 
chaeal–bacterial endosymbiosis in the laboratory would 
mean the completion of the bridge. This is an ex- 
tremely tall order but then again, who would have pre- 
dicted 25 years ago that complete genome sequencing 
of microbes that do not grow in culture would become 
a near routine exercise?
