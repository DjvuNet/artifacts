Recent progress in applying complex network 
theory to problems faced in quantum informa- 
tion and computation has resulted in a beneﬁcial 
crossover between two ﬁelds. Complex network 
methods have successfully been used to charac- 
terize quantum walk and transport models, en- 
tangled communication networks, graph theoretic 
models of emergent space-time and in detecting 
community structure in quantum systems. Infor- 
mation physics is setting the stage for a theory 
of complex and networked systems with quan- 
tum information-inspired methods appearing in 
complex network science, including information- 
theoretic distance and correlation measures for 
network characterization. Novel quantum in- 
duced eﬀects have been predicted in random 
graphs—where edges represent entangled links— 
and quantum computer algorithms have recently 
been proposed to oﬀer super-polynomial enhance- 
ment for several network and graph theoretic 
problems. Here we review the results at the cut- 
ting edge, pinpointing the similarities and recon- 
ciling the diﬀerences found in the series of results 
at the intersection of these two ﬁelds. 
Quantum mechanics has long been predicted to help 
solve computational problems in physics [1], chemistry [2], 
and machine learning [3] and to oﬀer quantum security 
enhancement in communications [4], including a quantum 
secure Internet [5]. Network and graph theory funda- 
mentally arises in nearly all aspects of quantum informa- 
tion and computation. Rapid experimental progress has 
pushed quantum computing and communication devices 
into truly data-intensive domains, where even the classical 
network describing a quantum system can exhibit complex 
features, giving rise to what appears as a paradigm shift 
needed to face a fundamental type of complexity [6–13]. 
Methods originating in complex networks—traditionally 
based on statistical mechanics—are now being generalized 
to the quantum domain in order to address these new 
quantum complexity challenges.

Building on several fundamental discoveries [14, 15], 
complex network theory has demonstrated that many 
(non-quantum) systems exhibit similarities in their com- 
plex features [14–18], in the organization of their struc- 
ture and dynamics [19–24], the controllability of their 
constituents [25] and their resilience to structural and dy- 
namical perturbations [26–31]. Certain quantum systems 
have been shown to indeed exhibit complex features re- 
lated to classical systems, as well as novel mechanisms and 
principles that interrelate complex features in quantum 
systems [6–13]. 
Two types of quantum networks have been of primary 
focus in the series of pioneering results we review. The 
ﬁrst consists of quantum systems whose connections are 
represented by entangled states [6, 32, 33]. These quan- 
tum networks are used in secure quantum communication 
systems. The second area of focus consists of networks of 
quantum systems, such as atoms or superconducting quan- 
tum electronics, whose connections are physical [34–39]. 
Such systems are used to develop quantum-enhanced algo- 
rithms or quantum information transport systems, both 
modeled by quantum walks on complex networks. At a 
fundamental level, the two types of quantum networks are 
described by quantum information theory, allowing one to 
extend the spectrum of network descriptors—such as rank- 
ing indicators, similarity and correlation measures—inside 
the quantum domain. 
Interestingly, the same tools can then be appropriately 
modiﬁed to apply to traditional complex networks, sug- 
gesting the existence of a framework—network informa- 
tion theory—suitable for application to both classical and 
quantum networked systems [13, 40, 41]. This bidirec- 
tional cross-over is carving out a coherent path forward 
built fundamentally on the intersection of these two ﬁelds 
(see Fig. 1). Fundamentally, several quantum eﬀects are 
still outside of the predictive range of applicability of 
complex network theory. Future work should build on 
recent breakthroughs and head towards a new theory of 
complex networks which augments the current statistical 
mechanics approach to complex networks, with a theory 
built fundamentally on quantum mechanics. Such a uni- 
ﬁed path forward appears to be through the language of 
information theory. 
Here, we make an eﬀort to review some of the crucial 
steps towards the creation of a network theory based 
fundamentally on quantum eﬀects. Therefore, we do

not cover several topics that, nevertheless, deserve to be 
mentioned as part of the ﬁeld. These include, in no par- 
ticular order, quantum gravity theories based on complex 
networks [42–45], synchronization in and on quantum 
networks [46], quantum random circuits [47, 48], classical 
spin models and quantum statistics successfully used in 
complex network theory [49–51] (see [52] for a thorough 
review). 
I. QUANTUM NETWORKS BASED ON 
ENTANGLED STATES 
The reader not familiar with some basic concepts of 
network science might ﬁnd useful a few deﬁnitions. A 
network is an abstract representation of relationships (en- 
coded by edges) between units (encoded by nodes) of a 
complex system. Edges can be directed, i.e. they can 
represent information incoming to or outgoing from a 
node and, in general, they can be weighted by real num- 
bers. The number of incoming, outgoing and total edges 
is known as incoming, outgoing and total degree of a 
node, respectively. The sum of the corresponding weights 
deﬁnes the incoming, outgoing and total strength of that 
node, respectively. Networks are often characterized by 
how node degree and strength are distributed and corre- 
lated. Systems modeled by uncorrelated networks with 
homogeneous degree distribution are known as Erdos- 
Renyi networks, whereas systems with power-law degree 
distribution are known as scale-free networks. We refer 
to [16, 53] for reviews of network concepts and models. 
To deﬁne quantum networks based on entangled states, 
let us start from the state of each ith qubit, written 
without loss of generality, as 
|ψi = cos(αi) |0 + e−iθi sin(βi) |1 , (1) 
with |0 and |1 the preferred or ‘computational’ basis. 
The qubit is in a pure, coherent superposition of the two 
basis states and any measurement in this same basis will 
cause the state to collapse onto |0 or |1 , with probability 
cos2(αi) and sin2(βi), respectively. Let us consider a 
quantum system with two qubits, i.e. i = 1 and 2. The 
basis of this system is given by the so called, tensor 
product, of the two basis states: |00 , |01 , |10 and |11 . 
If the two qubits are not entangled, i.e. their states are 
independent from each other, then the state of the overall 
system can be written as e.g. |ψ12 = |ψ1 ⊗ |ψ2 , whereas 
this is not possible if the two qubits are entangled. A 
generalization of this description to the case of mixed 
states is obtained in terms of the non-negative density 
matrix ρ; a unit trace Hermitian operator representing 
the state of the system as an ensemble of (unknown) pure 
states. 
Instead of distributing entanglement on regular graphs, 
such as uniform lattices typically studied in condensed 
matter physics, it has been shown that it is possible to 
tune the amount of entanglement between two nodes 
in such a way that it equals the probability to have a 
link in (classical) Erdos-Renyi graphs [6]. Such random 
graphs can be deﬁned by the family of networks G(N, p), 
where N is the number of nodes and p the probability 
to ﬁnd a link between any two nodes. The probability 
scales with the size of the network following a power 
law p ∝ N −z , with z ≥ 0. In classical network theory, 
there exists a critical value for the probability pc(N) for 
which, if p > pc(N) a given subgraph of n nodes and l 
links has higher probability to be observed. The classical 
result is that this critical probability scales with N as 
pc(N) ∝ N−n/l. 
Acin, Cirac, and Lewenstein [6] formulated an elegant 
extension of this picture to the quantum realm by replac- 
ing each link with an entangled pair of particles, where 
the probability pi,j = p that the link exists between nodes 
i and j is substituted by a quantum state ρi,j := ρ of two 
qubits, one at each node. One can build a quantum net- 
work where each node consists of N − 1 qubits which are 
entangled, in pairs, with qubits of other nodes. However, 
in this case, although the connections are identical and 
pure they encode non-maximally entangled pairs. For 
pure states of qubits, ρ = |φ φ|, with 
|φ=1 
√2 2−p|00 +√p|11 . (2) 
Here, 0 ≤ p ≤ 1 quantiﬁes the entanglement of links and 
the state of the overall quantum random graph can be 
denoted by |G(N, p) . If each link, i.e. each entangled 
pair, attempts to convert its state to the maximally entan- 
gled one (p = 1/2) through local operations and classical 
communication (LOCC), the optimal probability of suc- 
cessful conversion is exactly p. It follows that the fraction 
of existing entangled states converted to maximally en- 
tangled ones by LOCC corresponds to the probability of 
having a link between nodes in the corresponding clas- 
sical random network [6]. By varying the value of the 
parameter z, i.e. how the critical probability scales with 
system size, it is possible to control the number and type 
of subgraphs present in a quantum network of N nodes. 
This is useful to create special multipartite states, such as 
the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state which exhibits non- 
classical correlations [54]. The striking result is that it is 
possible to obtain, with probability approaching unity, a 
quantum state with the topology of any ﬁnite subgraph 
for N approaching inﬁnity and z = −2. 
This bridge between complex network theory and quan- 
tum theory provides a powerful tool to investigate the 
critical properties of a quantum system. For instance, in 
the case of regular lattices, it has been shown that the 
probability popt to establish a perfect quantum channel 
between the nodes can be mapped to the probability of dis- 
tributing links among each pair of nodes in the lattice [6], 
a scenario that can be studied using the well-established 
bond-percolation theory from statistical physics. This 
result allows one to calculate the critical probability above 
which the system will exhibit an inﬁnite connected clus- 
ter and, in the case of qubits, it has been shown that 
the probability of having an entangled path with inﬁ-

shaded regions represent published ﬁndings that map out the ﬁeld from theoretical, experimental and computational perspectives. 
The top area classiﬁes the analytical tools inspired by quantum information for classical network analysis and vice versa—both 
covered in this review—as well as the algorithms, genuinely quantum, developed to address speciﬁc problems in network science. 
The classiﬁcation in the bottom area includes quantum networks based on entangled states and on physical connections—covered 
in this review—as well as quantum network models of space-time, random quantum circuits, random tensor networks and 
geometry. 
nite length—i.e., an inﬁnite sequence of entangled states 
connecting an inﬁnite number of qubits—is unity. How- 
ever, for product states this probability is zero, denoting 
the existence of a sharp transition between these two 
scenarios. However, local measurements based on this ap- 
proach, called classical entanglement percolation (CEP), 
are not optimal, in general, to generate maximally en- 
tangled states: CEP is not even asymptotically optimal 
for two-dimensional lattices and new quantum protocols 
based on quantum entanglement percolation have to be 
used instead [6]. A novel critical phenomenon, deﬁning 
an entanglement phase transition, emerges from this new 
strategy, where the critical parameter is the degree of 
entanglement required to be distributed in order to es- 
tablish a quantum channel with probability that does 
not decay exponentially with the size of the system, at 
variance with CEP. This type of enhancement with re- 
spect to the classical case has been reported for diﬀerent 
network topologies, such as Erdos-Renyi, scale-free and 
small-world networks [32]. 
The static entangled states providing the network con- 
nectivity described here, will be replaced in the next 
section by dynamical processes on networked quantum 
systems.

II. QUANTUM NETWORKS BASED ON 
PHYSICAL CONNECTIVITY 
Another wide area where network concepts have found 
applicability consists of quantum systems physically in- 
terconnected, such as atoms or superconducting quantum 
electronics [34–39]. These types of systems provide fer- 
tile ground where quantum algorithms are tested [55–59] 
and quantum information transport systems are studied 
[60–62]. Typical modeling approaches are based on so 
called ‘quantum walks’ on complex networks, with recent 
studies showing that quantum information tasks, typi- 
cally designed for simple topologies, retain performance in

very disordered structures [63]. Stochastic (non-quantum) 
walks are also a central model in complex network theory— 
see the review [64]. 
Any quantum process can be viewed as a single particle 
walk on a graph. Single-particle quantum walks represent 
a universal model of quantum computation—-meaning 
that any algorithm for a quantum computer can be trans- 
lated into a quantum walk on a graph—and, additionally, 
quantum walks have been widely studied in the realm of 
quantum search on graphs, in both continuous and dis- 
crete time via coined walks (see e.g. [55–58]—in particular 
the graph optimality results [63]). The computational 
advantages of quantum versus stochastic random walk 
based algorithms has attracted wide interest with typical 
focus being on general graphs which consequently do not 
exhibit complex features. However, many works have 
compared properties of stochastic [65, 66] and quantum 
random walks [60–62] on complex networks [67]. 
Network topology has further been shown as a means 
to direct transport by adding complex numbers—while 
maintaining Hermiticity—to the networks adjacency ma- 
trix in ‘chiral quantum walks’ [62, 68, 69] (note that chiral 
walks were realized experimentally in [12]). Open system 
walks which mix stochastic and quantum eﬀects in ‘open’ 
evolutions [61] have aided in the study of quantum ef- 
fects in biological exciton transport (again, modeled as a 
quantum walk) and developments in a quantum version of 
Google’s PageRank [8–10] has been seen, providing a prac- 
tical solution to overcome the degeneracy issues aﬀecting 
the classical version and enhancing node ranking in large 
networks. Recently, Faccin et al. have analytically solved 
a model which shed light on some key diﬀerences between 
stochastic and quantum walks on complex networks [7]. 
These diﬀerences push forward a general understanding 
which can lead to a theory explaining novel complex fea- 
tures in quantum systems. 
Quantum walks on complex networks represent both a 
practical model of transport [67] as well as an interesting 
stage of comparison between the quantum and stochastic 
cases. As a closed quantum system exhibits ﬂuctuations 
in the probabilities in time, typically a long time average 
is considered. Physically, this is the best approximation 
one can hope for, provided that there is no knowledge of 
when the walk started. In this case, the probability to 
ﬁnd a quantum walker in the i-th node is given by 
p(i) = lim 
T→∞ 1 
T 
T 
0 dt| i|Ut|0 |2, 
(3) 
where |0 is the initial state and Ut = e−iQt is the unitary 
evolution operator deﬁned by the quantum generator Q. 
Interference between subspaces of diﬀerent energy van- 
ish in the long time average so we obtain an expression for 
the probability (PQ)i in terms of the energy eigen-space 
projectors Πj of the Hamiltonian HQ, 
(PQ)i = j i|Πj ρ(0)Πj|i . 
(4) 
Here Πj = k |φkj φkj | projects onto the subspace 
spanned by the eigenvalues |φkj of HQ corresponding 
to the same eigenvalue λj . 
Quantum-enhanced page-ranking. The non- 
symmetric adjacency matrix representing the directed 
connectivity of the World Wide Web, a.k.a. the Google 
matrix G, satisﬁes the Perron-Frobenius theorem [70] and 
hence there is a maximal eigenvalue corresponding to an 
eigenvector of positive entries Gp = p. The eigenvector 
p corresponds to the limiting distribution of occupation 
probabilities of a random web surfer—it represents a 
unique attractor for the dynamics independently of the 
initial state. The vector p is known as the Page-Rank. 
Several recent studies embed G into a quantum system 
and consider quantum versions of Google’s Page-Rank [8– 
10]. Garnerone et al. [71] relied on an adiabatic quantum 
algorithm to compute the Page-Rank of a given directed 
network, whereas Burillo et al. [11] rely on a mixture of 
unitary and dissipative evolution to deﬁne a ranking that 
converges faster than classical PageRank. 
The page-ranking vector p is an eigenvector of ■ − G 
corresponding to the zero eigenvalue (the lowest). This 
fact leads to a deﬁnition of a Hermitian operator which 
can play the role of a Hamiltonian, deﬁned as: 
hp =(■−G)†(■−G), 
(5) 
though highly non-local, its ground state represents the 
target Page-Rank which could be found by adiabatic 
quantum annealing into the ground state. Using a quan- 
tum computer to accelerate the calculation of various 
network properties has been considered widely [55–58]. 
As Page-Rank relies on ﬁnding the vector corresponding 
to the lowest eigenvalue of the Google matrix, the adia- 
batic algorithm opens the door up to accelerate network 
calculations using quantum computers. 
Directing transport by symmetry breaking in 
chiral walks. Chiral quantum walks, introduced by 
Zimbor´ 
as et al. in [62] and realized experimentally in 
[12] append complex numbers to the adjacency matrix 
(playing the role of the system Hamiltonian) while still 
maintaining the Hermitian property [12, 62, 68, 69]. These 
complex phases in many cases do not eﬀect transfer prob- 
abilities: the theory explaining this ﬁnding was developed 
in [12, 62], without relying on approximations or averag- 
ing. The case of open systems has been investigated as 
well in [62]. In the scenarios where the addition of com- 
plex phases aﬀects transfer probabilities, the underlying 
system breaks time-reversal symmetry and, consequently, 
the probability ﬂow into the quantum system is biased. 
This fact enables directed state transfer without requiring 
a biased (or non-local) distribution in the initial states, 
or coupling to an environment. 
When the underlying graph is bipartite (e.g. a graph 
whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such as 
a square lattice), time-reversal symmetry in the transport 
probabilities can not be broken. Transport suppression 

/*** End Page =3= ***/

5 
is indeed possible however [62]. Bipartite graphs include 
trees, linear chains and generally, graphs with only even 
cycles. These results point to a subtle interplay between 
the topology of the underlying graph, giving rise to a new 
challenge for dynamical control of probability transfer 
when considering walks on complex networks [12, 62, 68, 
69]. 
Open quantum walks. The area of open quan- 
tum systems [72] studies noise and its eﬀects in quantum 
systems. The adiabatic version of Page-Rank [9] uses a 
quantum stochastic quantum walk as proposed by [61] 
(see also [73, 74] for studies on open walks). 
Quantum stochastic walks are deﬁned by a quantum 
walk undergoing dissipative dynamics. The latter follows 
the quantum master equation in the Lindbladian form: 
˙ρ = ▲[ρ] 
(6) 
= −i[H,ρ]+ k LkρL†k −1 
2 L†kLk,ρ (7) 
where Lk represents a jump operator while [·, ·] and {·, ·} 
are commutator and anti-commutator respectively. 
The network topology is embedded by choosing H equal 
to the adjacency matrix of the symmetrized network and 
Lk = Lij = Gij |i j|. In this picture, node ranking is 
deﬁned by an activity vector α computed at the steady 
state ρss . 
Paparo et al. [8, 10] introduced a Szegedy type of 
Markov chain quantization [75] of the random walk. In 
order to quantize the Markov chain deﬁned by the Google 
matrix G of N nodes, one introduces a Hilbert space 
H = span{|i 1|j 2 ,i,j∈[0,N]}and the superposition of 
outgoing edges from node i: 
|ψi =|i1⊗k Gki|k2 
(8) 
and 
Π= 
k |ψk ψk|. 
(9) 
Each step of the quantum walk U is deﬁned by a coin ﬂip 
2Π − ✶ and a swap operation S which ensures unitarity [8] 
U=S(2Π−✶) 
(10) 
the swap operator is S = ij |ij ji|. 
In the case of quantum Page-Rank, this is set to the 
instantaneous probability P (i, t) of ﬁnding the walker 
at node i at the time-step t. To obtain a ﬁxed value 
for the quantum Page-Rank a time average is calculated 
as long as with its variance as a measure for quantum 
ﬂuctuations. 
Another approach [11] involves deﬁning a Markov quan- 
tum evolution similar to (7), with a tuning parameter α: 
˙ρ = −i(1−α)[H,ρ]+α 
kLkρL†k−1 
2{L†kLk, ρ} (11) 
where the Hamiltonian H is the symmeterized adjacency 
matrix and Lk = Lij = Gij |i i| represent the jump 
operators which consider the directness of the network. 
With this deﬁnition, for values of α ∈ (0, 1], a stationary 
state is guaranteed. In this case, for α = 0 we revert to 
the unitary evolution while for α = 1 we revert to the 
stochastic case. 
The authors [8, 10, 11] show how this deﬁnition of 
quantum Page-Rank resolves problems of degeneracy in 
the classical Page-Rank deﬁnition, enhances the impor- 
tance of secondary hubs and, for certain values of α, the 
algorithm exhibits faster convergence.

This yields the graph Laplacian L = D − A, and hence, the

transform results in LQ = D−1/2LD−1/2 , which generates a 
valid quantum walk and exhibits several interesting connec- 
tions to the classical case. The mapping L −→ L⊤L preserves 
the lowest 0 energy ground state, opening the door for adia- 
batic quantum annealing which solves computational problems 
by evolving a system into its ground state. 
III. TOWARDS UNIFIED ANALYSIS OF 
NETWORK COMPLEXITY 
The interaction between network science and quantum 
information science has led to the development of theoret- 
ical and computational tools that beneﬁtted from both 
ﬁelds. On the one hand, quantum-inspired tools, such 
as information entropies and quantum distance measures, 
have been successfully applied to practical problems con- 
cerning classical complex networks [13]. On the other 
hand, classical network descriptors have been ported to 
the quantum realm to gain better insights about the struc- 
ture and the dynamics of networked quantum systems [76]. 

/*** End Page =4= ***/
/*** Page =5= ***/
6 
The cross-pollination between the two ﬁelds, brieﬂy re- 
viewed in this section, is still ongoing with vibrant future 
research opportunities. 
Information entropy of classical networks. His- 
torically, the concept of entropy has been successfully 
used to quantify the complexity of many systems [77, 78]. 
Recently, the possibility of using quantum entropy and 
other quantum information theoretical measures has been 
explored by the community of network scientists. 
For classical complex networks, von Neumann’s entropy 
has been applied over one decade ago [79]. The combina- 
torial Laplacian matrix L, obtained from the adjacency 
matrix representing the network, is rescaled by the num- 
ber of edges in the network. The normalization of the 
matrix L guarantees that the corresponding eigenvalues 
are non-negative and sum up to 1—in order to be inter- 
preted as probabilities [80]—and some other properties 
which makes the resulting object similar to a quantum 
density matrix ρ. Network entropy is deﬁned according 
to von Neumann quantum entropy as 
S(ρ) = −Tr(ρ log2 ρ). 
(12) 
By exploiting the eigen-decomposition of the Laplacian 
matrix, it can be shown that this entropy corresponds to 
the Shannon entropy of the eigenvalue spectrum of ρ. This 
entropy has been generalized to the case of multilayer 
systems [81], composite networks where units exhibit 
diﬀerent types of relationships that are generally modeled 
as diﬀerent layers (see [17, 18, 82] for a thorough review). 
It has been recently shown that the von Neumann 
entropy calculated from the rescaled Laplacian does 
not satisfy the sub-additivity property in some circum- 
stances [13, 40]. This undesirable feature can be addressed 
by means of a more grounded deﬁnition [13], whose ratio- 
nale is to measure the entropy of a network by exploiting 
how information diﬀuses through its topology (see Fig. 4A– 
B). Information diﬀusion in this context is governed by 
the equation 
˙ψi(t) = − 
N 
j=1 Lijψj(t), 
(13) 
with ψi(t) the amount of information in node i at time t. 
The solution of this diﬀusion equation is given, in vector 
notation, by ψ(t) = exp(−Lt)ψ(0), whose normalized 
propagator is used to deﬁne the density matrix as 
ρ= e−τL 
Tr(e−τ L) , 
(14) 
where time plays the role of a resolution parameter allow- 
ing one to probe entropy at diﬀerent scales [13]. A similar 
approach, involving a modiﬁed Laplacian matrix, has 
been recently used for revealing the mesoscale structure 
of complex directed networks [83, 84]. 
This quantum-inspired framework provides a power- 
ful basis to develop an information theory of complex 
networks, with direct applications in classical network 
science, such as system comparison. 
Comparing classical networks. A known problem 
in network science is to compare two networks, without 
relying on a speciﬁc subset of indicators. Network infor- 
mation entropy allows one to introduce relative entropies 
such as the Kullback-Leibler divergence, to compare two 
networks with density matrices ρ and σ respectively: 
D(ρ||σ) = Tr[ρ(log2 ρ − log2 σ)]. (15) 
By exploiting the well-known classical result that the 
minimization of Kullback-Leibler divergence between a 
reference distribution and its parametric model corre- 
sponds to the maximization of the likelihood, it has been 
shown that in a network context this allows one to deﬁne 
the network log-likelihood by 
log2 L(Θ) = Tr[ρ log2 σ(Θ)]. 
(16) 
The introduction of network likelihood (see Fig. 4C) opens 
the door to a variety of applications in statistical inference 
and model selection, based on concepts such as the Fisher 
information matrix, Akaike and Bayesian information 
criteria, and minimum description length, to cite some of 
them [13]. 
This new framework has been used to compare networks 
for several purposes. For instance, in the case of pairs of 
networks, the graphs are ﬁrst merged by connecting each 
node from one network to any other node in the other 
network. Successively, continuous-time quantum walks 
are used to explore the composite system and the quantum 
Jensen-Shannon divergence between the evolution of two 
walks is calculated. This divergence, that is a measure 
of (dis)similarity, is shown to be maximum when the two 
original networks are isomorphic [57]. 
The square root of quantum Jensen-Shannon divergence 
has the nice property of deﬁning a metric, allowing one 
to deﬁne a distance between networks. If ρ and σ are two 
density matrices corresponding to two networks with N 
nodes, their Jensen-Shannon divergence is deﬁned by 
DJS(ρ||σ) = 1 
2DKL(ρ||µ) + 1 
2 DKL(σ||µ) (17) 
=S(µ)− 1 
2[S(ρ) + S(σ)], (18) 
that is the diﬀerence between the entropy of the mix- 
tureµ= 1 
2 (ρ + σ) and the semi-sum of the entropies of 
the original systems. In the context of multilayer sys- 
tems, this measure has been used to quantify the distance 
between layers of a multiplex network, cluster and aggre- 
gate them appropriately in order to reduce its structural 
complexity [40]. 
These ideas have quickly found direct applications in 
biology. In genetic molecular systems, such as the ones 
described by gene-protein interactions, layers might en- 
code diﬀerent relationships among molecules—functional, 
e.g. additive, suppressive and other types of association, 
or physical, e.g. co-localization or direct interaction. The

random wiring [53], to mention some of them, were de- 
veloped to reproduce degree distributions commonly ob- 
served in empirical systems. Despite the complexity of 
the linking pattern, the degree distribution of a network 
aﬀects in a simple way the ongoing dynamics. In fact, it 
can be shown that the probability of ﬁnding a memoryless 
random walker—at a given node of a symmetric network 
at the stationary state—is just proportional to the degree 
of such node [65]. 
In [7] the authors consider the relationship between 
the stochastic and the quantum version of such processes, 
with the ultimate goal of shedding light on the meaning of 
degree centrality in the case of quantum networks. They 
consider a stochastic evolution governed by the Laplacian 
matrix LS = LD−1, the stochastic generator that charac- 
terizes classical random walk dynamics and leads to an 
occupation probability proportional to node degree. In 
the quantum version, an hermitian generator is required 
and the authors proposed the symmetric Laplacian ma- 
trixLQ=D−1 
2LD−1 
2 , generating a valid quantum walk 
that, however, does not lead to a stationary state, mak- 
ing diﬃcult a direct comparison between classical and 
quantum versions of the dynamics. A common and useful 
workaround to this issue is to average the occupation 
probability over time (4). 
The generators of the two dynamics are spectrally 
similar (see Fig. 3) and share the same eigenvalues, 
while the eigenvectors are related by the transformation 
φC 
i =D−1 
2φQ 
i . As a consequence, if the system is in the 
ground state the average probability to ﬁnd the walker 
on a node will be the same as in the classic case, which 
will depend solely on the degree of each node. For the 
cases in which the system is not in the ground state, it is 
possible to deﬁne a quantumness measure 
ε=1−φQ 
0|ρ0|φQ 
0, 
describing how far from the classical case the probability 
distribution of the quantum walker will be. In the case 
of uniformly distributed initial state ρ0, this provides a 
measure for the heterogeneity of the degree distribution 
of a quantum network. 
Mesoscale organization of quantum systems. 
Community detection, and in general mesoscopic struc- 
ture detection, has been widely studied in the literature 
of classical complex networks [90, 91]. While the deﬁni- 
tion of community “a subset of nodes tightly connected 
compared to what is expected” is in general ill deﬁned 
and part of an ongoing debate, the number of proposed 
algorithms is incredibly high and still growing. 
The cross-pollination of community detection with 
quantum mechanics is in two levels. On the one hand, 
chronologically, the ﬁrst attempt was to borrow tools 
from quantum mechanics for applications to classical sys- 
tems [83, 92–95]. On the other hand an algorithm to ﬁnd 
communities in complex quantum systems was proposed 
in [76]. 
In [92, 93] the authors propose a method for data clus- 
tering similar to kernel density estimators, in a quantum 
framework. The given data points are mapped to a Gaus-

sian wave function and, supposing that the latter is an 
eigenstate for some time-independent Schr¨ 
odingher equa- 
tion: 
Hψ=[T+V(x)]ψ=E0ψ, 
the minimization of the potential V (x) leads to the desired 
clustering. An extension to dynamical quantum systems 
has been introduced in [94]. In this case the expectation 
values of the position operator evolves in time toward the 
closer minimum of the potential. This formulation can 
leverage the acceleration of graphics hardware. 
A method based on continuous-time quantum walks 
was proposed in [95]. Here a node aﬃnity measure based 
on the response of node population density to link failure 
was given. If the population on two nodes changes in a 
similar manner after link removal, they are more likely to 
belong to the same community. 
A magnetic Laplacian, where a magnetic ﬁeld is ex- 
pected to traverse all cycles in the network, was used 
in [83]. With an approach similar to chiral walks, pre- 
viously described, the symmetric Laplacian is amended 
with the original link directionality by a phase term e±iθ , 
with θ being a parameter for the method, and used for 
community detection in directed networks, a longstanding 
problem in network science. 
In the case of quantum systems, partitioning in mod- 
ular units has been often carried out on the basis of ad 
hoc considerations. In an eﬀort to extend community 
detection to the quantum mechanics realm, Faccin et 
al. [76] introduced several closeness matrices inspired by 
diﬀerent quantum quantities. Given the Hamiltonian 
H = ij Hij |i j| of the quantum system of interest, 
the authors consider a continuous-time random walk on 
the system topology. The ﬁrst quantity is energy trans- 
port, porting to the quantum realm the concept applied 
in several classical algorithms where communities are in- 
terpreted as traps for the dynamical process. In this 
framework, two nodes are considered to be close if, on 
average, their in-between transport is high. If this av- 
erage is computed over a short time period (compared 
to evolution time scales), then the closeness values are 
proportional to the Hamiltonian terms |Hij|, providing a 
classical approach to community detection (see Fig. 5). A 
second quantity, also proposed as a closeness measure, is 
related to the average ﬁdelity of the evolving process com- 
pared to the initial state. In this case the localization of 
eigenstates is the characteristic determining the closeness 
of two nodes. These methods augment current ad hoc 
approaches to partitioning nodes in quantum transport 
systems with enhanced methods based on community 
detection algorithms. 
IV. OUTLOOK IN QUANTUM NETWORK 
SCIENCE 
Generalization of complex network methods to the 
quantum setting represents a foundational advancement 
required to understand complexity in physical systems. 
These methods represent a change of paradigm which 
bring several road blocks that must be faced. Centrally, 
the application domain of complex network methods to 
quantum physics must be expanded, whereas studies in 
the other direction, i.e. where methods from the quantum 
domain have now been ported to network science. 
From a foundational perspective, as networks necessar- 
ily represent physical systems, such systems are inherently 
governed by the laws of information physics. In fact, a re- 
search line is emerging now that seeks to quantify, in terms 
of implicit information processing capacity, networked sys- 
tems, with several applications to social, technological 
and biological systems [13, 40, 41, 86, 87]. Although this 
interesting direction seems promising, yet it is compara- 
bly in its infancy, whereas it is still not known how to 
generalize classical concepts of complexity science to the 
quantum domain. 
Another relevant research direction, crucial for applica- 
tions in classical network science, concerns the interplay 
between structure and dynamics, which is almost entirely 
unclear in the case of quantum networks. Although scale- 
free networks have been considered in the quantum set- 
ting [32], the result is an—albeit interesting—toy model 
with theoretical predictions to be veriﬁed experimentally. 
Therefore, further advancement along this track is of cen- 
tral interest, because it might play a fundamental role in 
quantum enhanced technology and could lead to experi- 
ments devoted to test cross-disciplinary ideas in quantum 
and complexity science [33]. 
The quest for a theoretical foundation for quantum 
complex networks might have a deep impact in informa- 
tion and communication technology. While information 
processing in classical systems is well controlled, it is 
also rather limited and quantum computing might over- 
come such limitations [96, 97]. However, given that such 
systems are more sensitive to interactions with the en- 
vironment, they are also more exposed to errors than 
their classical counterparts. Quantum error-correcting 
codes allow us to store and manipulate quantum infor- 
mation in the presence of certain types of noise that, in 
this context, might perturb the quantum system caus- 
ing eﬀects similar to random failures in classical complex 
networks. The development of quantum error correction 
techniques that make quantum computing and quantum 
communication possible can not prescind from the study 
of ‘system resilience’, a topic that found uncountable ap- 
plications in classical network science [26, 28, 31, 98, 99]. 
Other types of perturbations that are natural for classical 
systems, such as targeted attacks of network hubs [26] 
or cascade-based attacks [100], still have no clear quan- 
tum counterpart and their study, from both theoretical 
and experimental perspectives, will play a key role in 
the development of a quantum Internet [5]. In fact, it is 
tantalizing to think about how quantum hubs should be 
protected by the quantum counterpart of typical denial 
of service attacks. 
Continued advances in the theory of complexity in net-

worked quantum systems will help address the challenges 
faced as quantum technologies scale up to commercially 
feasible products. Work towards a quantum theory of 
complex networked systems is already opening up novel 
avenues when facing contemporary complexity challenges.
