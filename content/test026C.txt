Fossils of macroscopic eukaryotes are rarely older than the Ediacaran Period (635–541 million 
years (Myr)), and their interpretation remains controversial. Here, we report the discovery of 
macroscopic fossils from the 1,560-Myr-old Gaoyuzhuang Formation, Yanshan area, North 
China, that exhibit both large size and regular morphology. Preserved as carbonaceous 
compressions, the Gaoyuzhuang fossils have statistically regular linear to lanceolate shapes 
up to 30 cm long and nearly 8 cm wide, suggesting that the Gaoyuzhuang fossils record 
benthic multicellular eukaryotes of unprecedentedly large size. Syngenetic fragments showing 
closely packed B10 mm cells arranged in a thick sheet further reinforce the interpretation. 
Comparisons with living thalloid organisms suggest that these organisms were 
photosynthetic, although their phylogenetic placement within the Eukarya remains uncertain. 
The new fossils provide the strongest evidence yet that multicellular eukaryotes with 
decimetric dimensions and a regular developmental program populated the marine biosphere 
at least a billion years before the Cambrian Explosion.

Unambiguous fossils of macroscopic eukaryotes are wide- 
spread in Ediacaran sedimentary rocks1–4, and recently 
this record has been extended downward into intraglacial 
shales (ca. 636 Myr) of the terminal Cryogenian Nantuo 
Formation, South China5. With this in mind, the late 
Neoproterozoic Era has commonly been viewed as a time of 
transition from an earlier microbial biosphere to the world of 
conspicuous macroscopic organisms we know today6. 
Statistically, this view is correct, but reports of older 
macroscopic fossils have been published for years, including the 
Mesoproterozoic helicoid Grypania7,8, string-of-beads 
impressions named Horodyskia9,10 and scattered carbonaceous 
compressions of irregular or indeterminate shape11,12. Both the 
cellular structure and phylogenetic afﬁnities of these fossils 
remain uncertain13,14. In particular, carbonaceous macrofossils 
up to 2 cm long, previously reported from upper Paleoproterozoic 
(41,625 Myr) shales in North China15,16, have irregular shapes 
and lack cellular structure, making it impossible to differentiate 
them from ripped-up and redeposited fragments of microbial 
mats13,17,18. Perhaps even more controversial are cm-scale pyritic 
structures from 2.1-billion-year-old shales in Gabon19,20. 
Here, we report an assemblage of large and unusually well- 
preserved carbonaceous compressions from the lower Mesopro- 
terozoic Gaoyuzhuang Formation in the Yanshan area, North 
China. Altogether, their large (decimetre-scale) size and regular, 
strongly elongate morphology differentiate these remains from 
contemporaneous or younger structures formed by the reworking 
of microbial mats. Rather, the Gaoyuzhang compressions closely 
resemble macroscopic eukaryotic organisms, especially benthic 
algae, observed today and in younger rocks. Phylogenetic 
placement of these remains is uncertain, but they indicate that 
simple macroscopic multicellularity evolved early in the eukar- 
yotic domain. 
Results 
Fossil localities and geological setting. The Proterozoic succes- 
sion in the Yanshan region (Fig. 1) consists of essentially unde- 
formed sedimentary rocks about 10 km thick, dated by means of 
zircon U-Pb ages from tuffs, ﬂows, sills and dykes21,22. 
Macrofossils were discovered at two localities in Qianxi and 
Kuancheng counties (Figs 1c and 2) within calcareous shales of 
the Gaoyuzhuang Formation22. The fossiliferous mudstones are 
rich in organic carbon (total organic carbon of 0.7–4.3%; 
mean 1.2%; see (ref. 23) and are thought to represent distal 
turbidites or tempestites deposited near storm wave base. 
The fossiliferous shales lie below an ash bed dated by U-Pb 
zircon analysis at 1,560±5 Myr and postdate 1,625±6.2 Myr 
ﬂows in the unconformably underlying Dahangyu Formation24,25 
(Figs 1d and 2). 
Description and interpretation of carbonaceous compressions. 
The fossils are preserved as carbonaceous compressions within 
mm- to cm-thick mudstone layers; they vary in size, orientation 
and degree of twisting or folding and, in general, appear to be 
allochthonous remains, deposited along with encompassing

muds transported over short distances (Fig. 3; Supplementary 
Figs 1,2). Small fragments with irregular shapes are common in 
the mudstone, but abundant, well-preserved compressions 
of large size and regular shape have been found in only a few 
horizons, particularly in the Qianxi area. We measured 167 
individuals with a dimension greater than 15 3 mm based 
on all the collected specimens (Supplementary Data 1 and 
Supplementary Table 1). In all, 53 individuals with regular shapes 
can be assigned to four morphotypes (Figs 3,4; Supplementary

(round end, but without parallel sides). Unlike mat fragments, 
these compressions have sharp margins on at least two sides. 
Each shape class shows a more or less normal size frequency 
distribution (Fig. 5). 
Cuneate fossils are up to 18 cm long with various divergence 
angles (10–25 ) characterizing the tapering end and a ribbon-like 
(up to 4.2 cm wide) distal part with sharp and nearly parallel 
margins (Fig. 3c,d). No holdfast was preserved in large specimens, 
but a rod-like basal stipe can be seen in one small cuneate 
specimen (Fig. 3f). The linear fossils are up 22.9 cm long and 
4.5 cm wide with ragged ends, suggesting they are fragments of 
larger individuals. The linear specimens (Fig. 3a(1),b(1),g) 
resemble the distal ends of cuneate compressions, and size 
frequency distributions for the two morphotypes overlap strongly 
(Fig. 5). Although slightly bent or twisted forms can be observed 
(Fig. 3g), most linear fossils are straight and have a smooth, 
slightly convex surface (Fig. 3a(1),b(1)), suggesting that the 
thallus was originally composed of mechanically strong organic 
materials. 
Morphometric data suggest that the linear and cuneate remains 
are drawn from the same source population, an interpretation 
further supported by statistical data on tapering ratios for all

individuals of both forms (Fig. 6). If this inference is correct, the 
source thalli could have reached lengths of 430 cm 
(Supplementary Fig. 3). Oblong fossils could also be drawn from 
this source, but one complete thallus (Fig. 3e) exhibits a narrow 
ribbon-like base with a terminal spheroidal expansion that may 
represent a distinct holdfast (Supplementary Fig. 3). 
Tongue-shaped remains are distinct in size as well as shape, 
suggesting that they record another distinctive thallus type 
(Figs 3b(2) and 5; Supplementary Fig. 3). The tongue-shaped 
fossils are the largest remains in the assemblage (Figs 3a(2),b(2) 
and 5), with dimensions up to 28.6 cm by 7.6 cm (Fig. 3b(2)). 
Blades clearly had a rounded distal end (Fig. 3b(2)), but the basal 
morphology remains unclear. Regular longitudinal striations run 
parallel to the long axis of the tongue-shaped fossils, providing 
further evidence of complex organization (Fig. 3b(2)). These 
broad fossils are commonly folded or otherwise deformed 
(Supplementary Fig. 1), suggesting a composition distinct from 
that of linear/conical thalli. 
Morphometric analysis (Figs 4–6) further supports the 
hypothesis that Gaoyuzhuang carbonaceous compressions 
preserve at least two and possibly three populations of large 
macroscopic thalli (Supplementary Fig. 3) that grew according to 
simple but regular developmental programs, and rules out their 
interpretation as colonial prokaryotes or irregular mat fragments. 
The regular elongated shapes (and much larger size) of the 
Gaoyuzhuang fossils clearly differentiate them from the irregular 
carbonaceous compressions reported from the older Tuanshanzi 
Formation in the same area15. Moreover, the size and shape 
distribution of the Gaoyuzhuang compressions (Fig. 5) essentially 
rule out interpretation as ripped up and redeposited microbial 
mat fragments. The only plausible alterative is that the 
Gaoyuzhuang compressions represent decimetre-scale 
macroscopic, multicellular eukaryotes, and that is how we 
interpret them here. 
Syngenetic multicellular fragments. The inference of organized 
multicellularity is reinforced by well-preserved cell sheets in 
organic fragments extracted from fossiliferous samples by acid 
maceration (Fig. 7). The fragments (up to 1 mm in diameter) 
consist of polyhedral cells 6–18 mm in diameter (mean 10 mm), 
closely packed to form a continuous surface. There is little 
evidence for cell ﬁles or other types of tissue organization. Neither 
is there evidence for cell differentiation within preserved sheets. 
The cellular fragments are translucent, with various optical 
densities under light microscopy, indicating they are made of 
thermally altered organic matter. This composition is

corroborated by Raman ﬁrst-order spectra, which are dominated 
by D and G bands characteristic of disordered carbonaceous 
material (kerogen; Fig. 7a; Supplementary Fig. 4). Raman ﬁrst- 
order spectra of in situ macrofossils (see Supplementary Fig. 5) 
are similar, supporting the syngeneity of cellular remains within 
the host rock. The cellular fragments can easily be differentiated 
from the reticulate vesicles of contemporaneous acritarchs (for 
example, Dictyosphaera and Shuiyousphaeridium) in both size 
and ornamentation26–28. We cannot unambiguously demonstrate 
that the cell sheets originated within the thalli, but the absence of 
other microscopic fossils or other evident sources for these 
fragments, and indeed the absence of comparable cell sheets with 
dimensions 41 mm in any known Mesoproterozoic deposit, 
makes attribution of the cell sheets to the macroscopic thalli 
reasonable. We emphasize that the interpretation of the thalli as 
macroscopic eukaryotes is strong regardless of how one evaluates 
the cell sheets. 
Discussion 
We conclude that the Gaoyuzhuang compressions record a modest 
diversity of macroscopic multicellular eukaryotic organisms that lived 
in shelf areas of early Mesoproterozoic oceans. Although large, the 
thalli are thin, which would have facilitated diffusion of nutrients and 
gases20,29,30. The longitudinal striations on tongue-shaped fossils 
(Fig. 3b(2)), along with evidence for apical growth and differentiated 
holdfasts, provide circumstantial evidence for at least limited cell 
differentiation. On the basis of the comparisons with modern 
organisms, the thalli were most likely photosynthetic, although one 
can imagine a possible osmotrophic alternative. Molecular clocks 
differ in their estimates of when photosynthesis became established in 
the common ancestor of archaeplastid (glaucocytsophyte, red and 
green) algae. For example, clock estimates by Yoon et al.31,Parfrey 
et al.32 and Eme et al.33 are consistent with the interpretation of 
Gaoyuzhuang fossils as archaeplastids, whereas reports by Douzery 
et al.34, Berney and Pawlowsky35 and the ATPase-a calculations of 
Shih and Matzke36 are not. If archaeplastids, most molecular clocks 
would favour placement of the Gaoyuzhuang populations in stem 
groups rather than crown group red or green algae. Alternatively, the 
fossil could represent extinct eukaryotes that evolved simple 
multicellularity and photosynthesis independently of extant taxa. 
Whatever their precise afﬁnities, the Gaoyuzhuang fossils provide 
the most compelling evidence yet reported that by the beginning of 
the Mesoproterozoic Era, 1,600 Myr ago, eukaryotic organisms had 
evolved macroscopic form, multicellularity with limited cell 
differentiation, and (probably) photosynthesis. If so, their rarity as 
fossils in pre-Ediacaran (4635 Myr) must reﬂect processes of 
preservation rather than simple biological absence. Continuing

Methods 
The fossil specimens for this study were collected from calcareous mudstone of the 
Zhangjiayu Member of the Gaoyuzhuang Formation at Doulingzi village, Qianxi 
and Yamenzi village, Kuancheng (Figs 1,2). Specimens are reposited at the Tianjing 
Institute of Geology and Mineral Resources, China Geological Survey. Collection 
numbers of illustrated specimens are 07kg1332, 07kg1331, Qg98017, Qg98021, 
Qg98024, Qg20011 and Qg20017. Morphometric data are provided in 
Supplementary Data 1 and Supplementary Table 1, including tapering 
ratio Wmax Wmin/L0 ;Wmax maximum width, Wmin minimum width, and 
L0 the longitudinal distance between the minimum width and maximum width. 
Thin sections were cut from rock samples perpendicular to bedding. Rock samples 
were rinsed with ethanol to remove any potential organic contamination and then 
demineralized by HF/HCl acid maceration to extract organic fossils. Laser micro- 
Ramanspectraoftheorganicfragmentswithcellularstructuresandmacrofossilsinthe 
host rock were collected on a Horiba-Jobin Labram 800 HR Raman spectrometer with 
an Olympus BX41 petrographic microscope at the Centre for Geobiology (CGB), 
University of Bergen, Norway, and a Horiba Xplora One Raman spectrometer with an 
Olympus BX41 petrographic microscope at the Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry 
(GIG), Chinese Academy of Sciences. All analyses were made through a 100 
objective, using 514 nm (CGB) and 532 nm (GIG) excitation of an Ar-ion laser adjusted 
to an absolute laser power of 15–20 mW, translating (with the use of a density ﬁlter) to 
an on-sample intensity of ca. 2.5 mW (CGB) and 1.67 mW (GIG). Raman spectra 
acquisitions were performed in multi-window mode with 2 10 (CGB) and 3 12 
(GIG) seconds running time and a spectral range of 150–2,000 cm 1,andtreatedwith 
software Lab Spec version 5.58.25 .
