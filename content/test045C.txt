THE LIFE OF BENVENUTO CELLINI BOOK FIRST [CONTINUED] CI WHILE I was engaged in prosecuting my affairs with so much vigour, there arrived a letter sent post-haste to me by the Car- dinal of Ferrara, which ran as follows: " Benvenuto, " our dear friend, — During these last days the most " Christian King here made mention of you, and said " that he should like to have you in his service. " Whereto I answered that you had promised me, " whenever I sent for you to serve his Majesty, that " you would come at once. His Majesty then an- " swered: 'It is my will that provision for his jour- " ney, according to his merits, should be sent him;' " and immediately ordered his Admiral to make me " out an order for one thousand golden crowns upon " the treasurer of the Exchequer. The Cardinal de' " Gaddi, who was present at this conversation, ad- " vanced immediately , and told his Majesty that it was " not necessary to make these dispositions, seeing that " he had sent you money enough, and that you were " already on the journey. If then, as I think probable, " the facls are quite contrary to those assertions of " Cardinal Gaddi, reply to me without delay upon " the receipt of this letter; for I will undertake to " gather up the fallen thread, and have the promised " money given you by this magnanimous King."

LIFE OF BENVENUTO CELLINI Now let the world take notice, and all the folk that dwell on it, what power malignant stars with ad- verse fortune exercise upon us human beings ! I had not spoken twice in my lifetime to that little simple- ton of a Cardinal de' Gaddi ; nor do I think that he meant by this bumptiousness of his to do me any harm, but only, through light-head edness and sense- less folly, to make it seem as though he also held the affairs of artists, whom the King was wanting, under his own personal supervision, just as the Car- dinal of Ferrara did. But afterwards he was so stu- pid as not to tell me anything at all about the mat- ter; elsewise, it is certain that my wish to shield a silly mannikin from reproach, if only for our coun- try's sake, would have made me find out some ex- cuse to mend the bungling of his foolish self-conceit. Immediately upon the receipt of Cardinal Ferrara's letter, I answered that about Cardinal de' Gaddi I knew absolutely nothing, and that even if he had made overtures of that kind to me, I should not have left Italy without informing his most reverend lord- ship. I also said that I had more to do in Rome than at any previous time ; but that if his Most Chris- tian Majesty made sign of wanting me, one word of his, communicated by so great a prince as his most reverend lordship, would suffice to make me set off upon the spot, leaving all other concerns to take their chance. After I had sent my letter, that traitor, the Peru- gian workman, devised a piece of malice against me, which succeeded at once, owing to the avarice of Pope Paolo da Farnese, but also far more to that of [4]

LIFE OF BENVENUTO CELLINI his bastard, who was then called Duke of Castro. 1 The fellow in question informed one of Signor Pier Luigi's secretaries that, having been with me as workman several years, he was acquainted with all my affairs, on the strength of which he gave his word to Signor Pier Luigi that I was worth more than eighty thousand ducats, and that the greater part of this property consisted in jewels, which jewels be- longed to the Church, and that I had stolen them in Castel Sant' Agnolo during the sack of Rome, and that all they had to do was to catch me on the spot with secrecy. It so happened that I had been at work one morn- ing, more than three hours before daybreak, upon the trousseau of the bride I mentioned; then, while my shop was being opened and swept out, I put my cape on to go abroad and take the air. Directing my steps along the Strada Giulia, I turned into Chiavica, and at this corner Crespino, the Bargello, with all his constables, made up to me, and said: "You are the Pope's prisoner." I answered: "Crespino, you have mistaken your man." "No," said Crespino, "you are the artist Benvenuto, and I know you well, and I have to take you to the Castle of Sant' Angelo, where lords go, and men of accomplishments, your peers." Upon that four of his under-officers rushed on me, and would have seized by force a dagger which I wore, and some rings I carried on my fin- ger; but Crespino rebuked them: "Not a man of you shall touch him : it is quite enough if you per- form your duty, and see that he does not escape 1 He had been invested ivith the Duchy of Castro in 1537.

While I was en- gaged in doing this, it crossed my mind that exactly on that very spot I had assassinated Pompeo. They took me straightway to the castle, and locked me in an upper chamber in the keep. This was the first time that I ever smelt a prison up to the age I then had of thirty-seven years. en Signor Pier Luigi, the Pope's son, had well consid- ered the large sum for which I stood accused ; so he begged the reversion of it from his most holy father, and asked that he might have the money made out to himself. The Pope granted this willingly, adding that he would assist in its recovery. Consequently, after having kept me eight whole days in prison, they sent me up for examination, in order to put an end if possible to the affair. I was summoned into one of the great halls of the papal castle, a place of much dignity. My examiners were, first, the Gov- ernor of Rome, called Messer Benedetto Conversini of Pistoja, 1 who afte'rwards became Bishop of Jesi; secondly, the Procurator-Fiscal, whose name I have forgotten; 2 and, thirdly, the judge in criminal cases, Messer Benedetto da Cagli. These three men began at first to question me in gentle terms, which after- wards they changed to words of considerable harsh- ness and menace, apparently because I said to them: " My lords, it is more than half-an-hour now since 1 Bishop of Forlimpopoli in 1537, and of Jesi in 1 540. 8 Benedetto Valenti.

LIFE OF BENVENUTO CELLINI you have been pestering me with questions about fables and such things, so that one may truly say you are chattering or prattling ; by chattering I mean talking without reason, by prattling I mean talking nonsense: therefore I beg you to tell me what it really is you want of me, and to let me hear from your lips reasonable speech, and not jabberings or nonsense." In reply to these words of mine, the Governor, who was a Pistojan, could no longer dis- guise his furious temper, and began: " You talk very confidently, or rather far too arrogantly; but let me tell you that I will bring your pride down lower than a spaniel by the words of reason you shall hear from me ; these will be neither jabberings nor nonsense, as you have it, but shall form a chain of arguments to answer which you will be forced to tax the utmost of your wits." Then he began to speak as follows: "We know for certain that you were in Rome at the time when this unhappy city was subject to the calamity of the sack ; at that time you were in this Castle of Sant' Angelo, and were employed as bom- bardier. Now since you are a jeweller and goldsmith by trade, Pope Clement, being previously acquainted with you, and having by him no one else of your profession, called you into his secret counsels, and made you unset all the jewels of his. tiaras, mitres, and rings; afterwards, having confidence in you, he ordered you to sew them into his clothes. While thus engaged, you sequestered, unknown to his Ho- liness, a portion of them, to the value of eighty thou- sand crowns. This has been told us by one of your workmen, to whom you disclosed the matter in your [7]

LIFE OF BENVENUTO CELLINI braggadocio way. Now, we tell you frankly that you must find the jewels, or their value in money: after that we will release you." cm When I heard these words, I could not hold from bursting into a great roar of laughter ; then, having laughed awhile, I said: "Thanks be to God that on this first occasion, when it has pleased His Divine Majesty to imprison me, I should not be imprisoned for some folly, as the wont is usually with young men. If what you say were the truth, I run no risk of having to submit to corporal punishment, since the authority of the law was suspended during that season. Indeed, I could excuse myself by saying that, like a faithful servant, I had kept back treasure to that amount for the sacred and holy Apostolic Church, waiting till I could restore it to a good Pope, or else to those who might require it of me; as, for instance, you might, if this were verily the case." When I had spoken so far, the furious Governor would not let me conclude my argument, but exclaimed in a burst of rage: "Interpret the affair as you like best, Benvenuto; it is enough for us to have found the property which we had lost; be quick about it, if you do not want us to use other measures than words." Then they began to rise and leave the chamber; but I stopped them, crying out: "My lords, my exami- nation is not over; bring that to an end, and go then where you choose." They resumed their seats in a very angry temper, making as though they did not mean to listen to a word I said, and at the same time c § :

LIFE OF BENVENUTO CELLINI as though the main point was gained ; for there lay all things needful to my venture. It happened on the evening of a certain feast-day that the castellan was seriously indisposed; his humours grew extrava- gant; he kept repeating that he was a bat, and if they heard that Benvenuto had flown away, they must let him go to catch me up, since he could fly by night most certainly as well or better than my- self; for it was thus he argued: "Benvenuto is a counterfeit bat, but I am a real one ; and since he is committed to my care, leave me to act; I shall be sure to catch him/' He had passed several nights in this frenzy, and had worn out all his servants, whereof I received full information through divers channels, but specially from the Savoyard, who was my friend at heart. On the evening of that feast-day, then, I made my mind up to escape, come what might; and first I prayed most devoutly to God, imploring His Divine Majesty to protect and succour me in that so perilous a venture. Afterwards I set to work at all the things I needed, and laboured the whole of the night. It was two hours before daybreak when at last I re- moved those hinges with the greatest toil; but the wooden panel itself and the bolt too offered such re- sistance that I could not open the door ; so I had to cut into the wood; yet in the end I got it open, and shouldering the strips of linen which I had rolled up like bundles of flax upon two sticks, I went forth and directed my steps toward the latrines of the keep. Spying from within two tiles upon the roof, I was able at once to clamber up with ease. I wore a C 27]

LIFE OF BENVENUTO CELLINI white doublet with a pair of white hose and a pair of half boots, into which I had stuck the poniard I have mentioned. After scaling the roof, I took one end of my linen roll and attached it to a piece of antique tile which was built into the fortress wall; it happened to jut out scarcely four fingers. In order to fix the band, I gave it the form of a stirrup. When I had attached it to that piece of tile, I turned to God and said: "Lord God, give aid to my good cause; you know that it is good; you see that I am aiding myself." Then I let myself go gently by degrees, supporting myself with the sinews of my arms, until I touched the ground. There was no moonshine, but the light of a fair open heaven. When I stood upon my feet on solid earth, I looked up at the vast height which I had descended with such spirit, and went gladly away, thinking I was free. But this was not the case; for the castellan on that side of the fortress had built two lofty walls, the space between which he used for stable and henyard; the place was barred with thick iron bolts outside. I was terribly disgusted to find there was no exit from this trap; but while I paced up and down debating what to do, I stumbled on a long pole which was covered up with straw. Not without great trouble I succeeded in placing it against the wall, and then swarmed up it by the force of my arms until I reached the top. But since the wall ended in a sharp ridge, I had not strength enough to drag the pole up after me. Accordingly I made my mind up to use a portion of the second roll of linen which I had there ; the other was left hanging

He had heard it said that the Pope made known his intention of compensating me for all I had gone through. It is true that the Pope be- gan by saying so, but he ended by saying quite the opposite. I then determined to confide in the young Greek, and said to him: " Dearest brother, they are plotting my ruin ; so now the time has come to help me. Do they imagine, when they heap those ex- traordinary favours on me, that I am not aware they are done to betray me?" The worthy young man answered: "My Benvenuto, they say in Rome that the Pope has bestowed on you an office with an in- come of five hundred crowns ; I beseech you there- fore not to let those suspicions deprive you of so great a windfall." All the same I begged him with clasped hands to aid me in escaping from that place, saying I knew well that a Pope of that sort, though he could do me much good if he chose, was really studying secretly, and to save appearances, how he might best destroy me ; therefore we must be quick and try to save me from his clutches. If my friend would get me out of that place by the means I meant to tell him, I should always regard him as the sav- iour of my life, and when occasion came would lay it down for him with gladness. The poor young man shed tears, and cried : " Oh, my dear brother, though you are bringing destruction on your head, I can- not but fulfil your wishes ; so explain your plan, and I will do whatever you may order, albeit much a- gainst my will." Accordingly we came to an agree- ment, and I disclosed to him the details of my C 43 ]

LIFE OF BENVENUTO CELLINI scheme, which was certain to have succeeded with- out difficulty. When I hoped that he was coming to execute it, he came and told me that for my own good he meant to disobey me, being convinced of the truth of what he had heard from men close to the Pope's person, who understood the real state of my affairs. Having nothing else to rely upon, I re- mained in despair and misery. This passed on the day of Corpus Domini 1539. cxv After my conversation with the Greek, the whole day wore away, and at night there came abundant provisions from the kitchen of the Pope ; the Car- dinal Cornaro also sent good store of viands from his kitchen ; and some friends of mine being present when they arrived, I made them stay to supper, and enjoyed their society, keeping my leg in splints be- neath the bed-clothes. An hour after nightfall they left me; and two of my servants, having made me comfortable for the night, went to sleep in the ante- chamber. I had a dog, black as a mulberry, one of those hairy ones, who followed me admirably when I went out shooting, and never left my side. Dur- ing the night he lay beneath my bed, and I had to call out at least three times to my servant to turn him out, because he howled so fearfully. When the servants entered, the dog flew at them and tried to bite them. They were frightened, and thought he must be mad, because he went on howling. In this way we passed the first four hours of the night. At the stroke of four the Bargello came into my room C 44 ]

LIFE OF BENVENUTO CELLINI with excuses drawn from all that they had suffered ; and the body gave them hope of better fortune. To this effe6t, then, by way of dialogue, I wrote as follows : Benvenuto in the body. Afflicled regents of my soul! Ah, cruel ye! have ye such hate of life? The Spirits of his soul. If Heaven against you roll, Who stands for us? who saves us in the strife? Let us, let us go toward better life! Benvenuto. Nay, go not yet awhile! Te shall be happier and lighter far — Heaven gives this hope — than ye were ever yet! The Spirits. We will remain some little while, * If only by great God you promised are Such grace that no worse woes on us be set. After this I recovered strength; and when I had heartened up myself, I continued reading in the Bible, and my eyes became so used to that darkness that I could now read for three hours instead of the bare hour and a half I was able to employ before. With profound astonishment I dwelt upon the force of God's Spirit in those men of great simplicity, who believed so fervently that He would bring all their heart's desire to pass. I then proceeded to reckon in my own case too on God's assistance, both be- cause of His divine power and mercy, and also be- C 54 J

LIFE OF BENVENUTO CELLINI cause of my own innocence ; and at all hours, some- times in prayer and sometimes in communion with God, I abode in those high thoughts of Him. There flowed into my soul so powerful a delight from these reflections upon God, that I took no further thought for all the anguish I had suffered, but rather spent the day in singing psalms and divers other compo- sitions on the theme of His divinity. I was greatly troubled, however, by one particular annoyance : my nails had grown so long that I could not touch my body without wounding it; I could not dress myself but what they turned inside or out, to my great torment. Moreover, my teeth began to perish in my mouth. I became aware of this because the dead teeth being pushed out by the living ones, my gums were gradually perforated, and the points of the roots pierced through the tops of their cases. When I was aware of this, I used to pull one out, as though it were a weapon from a scabbard , with- out any pain or loss of blood. Very many of them did I lose in this way. Nevertheless, I accommodated myself to these new troubles also; at times I sang, at times I prayed, and at times I wrote by means of the paste of brick-dust I have described above. At this time I began composing a Capitolo in praise of my prison, relating in it all the accidents which had befallen me. 1 This poem I mean to insert in its proper place. 1 Capitolo is the technical name for a copy of verses in terza rima on a chosen theme. Poems of this kind, mostly burlesque or satirical, voere very popular in Cellims age. 'They used to be written on trifling or obscene subjeSls in a mock-heroic style. Berni stamped the character of high art upon the species, which had long been in use among the unlettered vulgar. See for further particulars Symonds" Renaissance in Italy, vol. v. chap. xiv.

LIFE OF BENVENUTO CELLINI cxx The good castellan used frequently to send mes- sengers to find out secretly what I was doing. So it happened on the last day of July that I was rejoicing greatly by myself alone while I bethought me of the festival they keep in Rome upon the ist of August; and I was saying to myself: "In former years I kept the feast among the pleasures and the frailties of the world ; this year I shall keep it in communion with God. Oh, how far more happy am I thus than I was then ! "The persons who heard me speak these words reported them to the castellan. He was greatly an- noyed, and exclaimed: "Ah, God! that fellow lives and triumphs in his infinite distress, while I lack all things in the midst of comfort, and am dying only on account of him! Go quickly, and fling him into that deepest of the subterranean dungeons where the preacher Foiano was starved to death. 1 Perhaps when he finds himself in such ill plight he will be- gin to droop his crest." Captain Sandrino Monaldi came at once into my prison with about twenty of the castellan's servants. They found me on my knees ; and I did not turn at their approach, but went on paying my orisons be- fore a God the Father, surrounded with angels, and a Christ arising victorious from the grave, which I had sketched upon the wall with a little piece of 1 Fra Benedetto da Foiano had incurred the wrath of Pope Clement Vll. by preach- ing against the Medici in Florence.

LIFE OF BENVENUTO CELLINI give me wax or paper and the means of portraying this glory of God which was revealed to me, most assuredly shall I convince him of that which now perhaps he holds in doubt." cxxni The physicians gave the castellan no hope of his re- covery, yet he remained with a clear intelle6l, and the humours which used to affli6l him every year had passed away. He devoted himself entirely to the care of his soul, and his conscience seemed to smite him, because he felt that I had suffered and was suffering a grievous wrong. The Pope received information from him of the extraordinary things which I related ; in answer to which his Holiness sent word — as one who had no faith either in God or aught beside — that I was mad, and that he must do his best to mend his health. When the castellan received this message, he sent to cheer me up, and furnished me with writing materials and wax, and certain little wooden instruments employed in working wax, add- ing many words of courtesy, which were reported by one of his servants who bore me good-will. This man was totally the opposite of that rascally gang who had wished to see me hanged. I took the paper and the wax, and began to work; and while I was working I wrote the following sonnet addressed to the castellan: "If 7, my lord, could show to you the truth. Of that Eternal Light to me by Heaven In this low life revealed, you sure had given More heed to mine than to a monarch's sooth. [65 1

CXXIV On the following day, when the servant of the cas- tellan who was my friend brought me my food, I gave him this sonnet copied out in writing. Without informing the other ill-disposed servants who were my enemies, he handed it to the castellan. At that time this worthy man would gladly have granted me my liberty, because he fancied that the great wrong done to me was a main cause of his death. He took the sonnet, and having read it more than once, exclaimed: " These are neither the words nor the thoughts of a madman, but rather of a sound and worthy fellow." Without delay he ordered his sec- retary to take it to the Pope, and place it in his own hands, adding a request for my deliverance. While the secretary was on his way with my sonnet to the Pope, the castellan sent me lights for day and night, together with all the conveniences one could wish for in that place.

LIFE OF BENVENUTO CELLINI CXXVIII I am now obliged to take a step backwards, in or- der to resume the thread of some events which will be found in my Capitolo. While I was sojourn- ing those few days in the chamber of the Cardinal, and afterwards in the Pope's private garden, there came among my other friends to visit me a cashier of Messer Bindo Altoviti, who was called Bernardo Galluzzi. I had entrusted to him a sum of several hun- dred crowns, and the young man sought me out in the Pope's garden, expressing his wish to give back this money to the uttermost farthing. I answered that I did not know where to place my property, either with a dearer friend or in a place that seemed to me more safe. He showed the strongest possible repugnance to keeping it, and I was, as it were, obliged to force him. Now that Ihad left the castle for the last time, I discovered that poor Bernardo Galluzzi was ruined, whereby I lost my money. Now while I was still imprisoned in that dungeon, I had a terrible dream, in which it seemed to me that words of the greatest consequence were written with a pen upon my forehead; the being who did this to me repeated at least three times that I should hold my tongue and not report the words to any one. When I awoke I felt that my forehead had been meddled with. In my Capitolo upon the prison I have related many incidents of this sort. Among others, it was told me (I not knowing what I then prophesied ) how everything which afterwards hap- pened to Signor Pier Luigi would take place, so [ 75] MMMiWMMIMMMil I

I will not omit to relate another circumstance also, which is perhaps the most remarkable which has ever happened to any one. I do so in order to justify the divinity of God and of His secrets, who deigned to grant me that great favour; for ever since the time of my strange vision until now an aureole of glory (marvellous to relate) has rested on my head. This is visible to every sort of men to whom I have chosen to point it out; but those have been very few. This halo can be observed above my shadow in the morning from the rising of the sun for about two hours, and far better when the grass is drenched with dew. It is also visible at evening about sunset. I became aware of it in France at Paris; for the air in those parts is so much freer from mist, that one can see it there far better mani- fested than in Italy, mists being far more frequent among us. However, I am always able to see it and to show it to others, but not so well as in the coun- try I have mentioned. Now I will set forth the Capitolo I wrote in prison, and in praise of the said prison ; after that I will fol- low the course of the good and evil things which have happened to me from time to time; and I mean also to relate what happens in the future. r 7sn

Oppressed with car king pains in flesh and bone, Far from his native land full many a rood. If you would fain by worthy deeds be known, Seek to be prisoned without cause, lie long, And find no friend to listen to your moan. See that men rob you of your all by wrong; Add perils to your life; be used with force, Hopeless of help, by brutal foes and strong. Be driven at length to some mad desperate course; Burst from your dungeon, leap the castle wall; Recaptured, find the prison ten times worse. Now listen, Luca, to the best of all! Tour leg 'j been broken; you 've been bought and sold; Tour dungeon 's dripping ; you 've no cloak or shawl. Never one friendly word; your vicluals cold Are brought with sorry news by some base groom Of Prato — soldier now — druggist of old. 1 Cellini's Capitolo in Praise of the Prison is clearly made up of pieces written, as described above, in the dungeon of S. Angelo, and of passages which he afterwards composed to bring these pieces into a coherent whole. He has not displayed much literary skill in the redaction, and I have been at pains to preserve the roughness of the original. I 77]

No paper, pens, ink, fire, or tools of steel, To exercise the quick brain's teeming thought. Alack that I so little can reveal! Fancy one hundred for each separate ill: Full space and place I've left for prison weal! But now my former purpose to fulfil, And sing the dungeon's praise with honour due — For this angelic tongues were scant of skill. Here never languish honest men and true, Except by placemen's fraud, misgovernment, Jealousies, anger, or some spiteful crew. To tell the truth whereon my mind is bent, Here man knows God, nor ever stints to pray, Feeling his soul with hell's fierce anguish rent. Let one be famed as bad as mortal may, Send him in jail two sorry years to pine, He '11 come forth holy, wise, beloved alway. Here soul, flesh, clothes their substance gross refine; Each bulky lout grows light like gossamere; Celestial thrones before purged eyeballs shine. i 78 1

LIFE OF BENVENUTO CELLINI / 7/ tell thee a great marvel! Friend, give ear! The fancy took me on one day to write: Learn now what shifts one may be put to here. My cell I search, prick brows and hair upright, Then turn me toward a cranny in the door t And with my teeth a splinter disunite ; Next find a piece of brick upon the floor, Crumble a part thereof to powder small, And form a paste by sprinkling water o'er. 1 Then y then came Poesy with fiery call Into my carcass^ by the way methought Whence bread goes forth — there was none else at all. Now to return unto my primal thought: Who wills to know what weal awaits him, must First learn the ill that God for him hath wrought. The jail contains all arts in acl and trust; Should you but hanker after surgeon's skill, 'Twill draw the spoiled blood from your veins adust. Next there is something in itself that will Make you right eloquent, a bold brave spark , Big with high-soaring thoughts for good and ill. Blessed is the man who lies in dungeon dark, Languishing many a month, then takes his flight Of war, truce, peace he knows, and tells the mark. Needs be that all things turn to his delight; The jail has crammed his brains so full of wit, They '11 dance no morris to upset the wight. 1 The Italian is acqua morta ; probably a slang phrase for urine.

Nay , for myself I'll ever praise it more: Tet would I like one law passed — that the man Whose acls deserve it should not scape this score. Whoso hath gotten the poor folk in ban, I'd make him learn those lessons of the jail; For then he 'd know all a good ruler can : He 'd acl like men who weigh by reason s scale, Nor dare to swerve from truth and right aside, Nor would confusion in the realm prevail. While I was bound in prison to abide, Foison of priests, friars, soldiers I could see; But those who best deserved it least I spied. Ah! could you know what rage came over me, When for such rogues the jail relaxed her hold! This makes one weep that one was born to be! F 11 add no more. Now Fm become fine gold, Such gold as none flings lightly to the wind, Fit for the best work eyes shall e'er behold. Another point hath passed into my mind, Which I've not told thee, Luca; where I wrote Was in the book of one our kith and kind. 1 There down the margins I was wont to note Each torment grim that crushed me like a vice : The paste my hurrying thoughts could hardly float. 1 Un nostra parente.

LIFE OF BENVENUTO CELLINI shall give you money amply sufficient for your jour- ney home. I mean myself to go about a most impor- tant business without you, which for a long time I have had it in my mind to do." Our room adjoined that of the secretary; and I think it not improbable that he wrote to the Cardinal, and informed him of my purpose. However, I never knew anything for certain about this. The night passed without sleep, and I kept wearying for the day, in order to carry out my resolution. No sooner did it dawn than I ordered out the horses, made my preparations in a moment, and gave the two young men everything which I had brought with me, and fifty ducats of gold in addition. I reserved the same sum for myself, together with the diamond the Duke had given me; I only kept two shirts and some well-worn riding-clothes which I had upon my back . I found it almost impossible to get free of the two young men, who insisted upon going with me, what- ever happened. At last I was obliged to treat them with contempt, and use this language: " One of you has his first beard, and the other is just getting it ; and both of you have learned as much from me as I could teach in my poor art, so that you are now the first craftsmen among the youths of Italy. Are you not ashamed to have no courage to quit this go-cart, but must always creep about in leading-strings? The thing is too disgraceful ! Or if I were to send you away without money, what would you say then ? Come, take yourselves out of my sight, and may God bless you a thousand times. Farewell !" I turned my horse and left them weeping. Then C US}

LIFE OF BENVENUTO CELLINI I took my way along a very fair road through a for- est, hoping to make at least forty miles that day, and reach the most out-of-the-way place I could. I had already ridden about two miles, and during that short time had resolved never to revisit any of those parts where I was known. I also determined to abandon my art so soon as I had made a Christ three cubits in height, reproducing, so far as I was able, that infinite beauty which He had Himself re- vealed to me. So then, being thoroughly resolved, I turned my face toward the Holy Sepulchre. 1 Just when I thought I had got so far that nobody could find me, I heard horses galloping after. They filled me with some uneasiness, because that district is in- fested with a race of brigands, who bear the name of Venturers, and are apt to murder men upon the road. Though numbers of them are hanged every day, it seems as though they did not care. However, when the riders approached, I found they were a messenger from the King and my lad Ascanio. The former came up to me and said: "From the King I order you to come immediately to his presence." I replied: "You have been sent by the Cardinal, and for this reason I will not come." The man said that since gentle usage would not bring me, he had au- thority to raise the folk, and they would take me bound hand and foot like a prisoner. Ascanio, for his part, did all he could to persuade me, reminding me that when the King sent a man to prison, he kept him there five years at least before he let him out again. This word about the prison, when I re- • See above, p. 61, for Cellini s -uonxj in the Castle of S. Angelo.

LIFE OF BENVENUTO CELLINI membered what I had endured in Rome, struck such terror into me, that I wheeled my horse round briskly and followed the King's messenger. He kept perpetually chattering in French through all our journey, up to the very precin6ls of the court, at one time bullying, now saying one thing, then another, till I felt inclined to deny God and the world. XII On our way to the lodgings of the King we passed before those of the Cardinal of Ferrara. Standing at his door, he called to me and said : " Our most Chris- tian monarch has of his own accord assigned you the same appointments which his Majesty allowed the painter Lionardo da Vinci, that is, a salary of seven hundred crowns ; in addition, he will pay you for all the works you do for him; also for your journey hither he gives you five hundred golden crowns, which will be paid you before you quit this place/' At the end of this announcement, I replied that those were offers worthy of the great King he was. The messenger, not knowing anything about me, and hearing what splendid offers had been made me by the King, begged my pardon over and over again. Pagolo and Ascanio exclaimed: "It is God who has helped us to get back into so honoured a go-cart ! " On the day following I went to thank the King, who ordered me to make the models of twelve silver statues, which were to stand as candelabra round his table. He wanted them to represent six gods and six goddesses, and to have exactly the same height as C "7 ]
