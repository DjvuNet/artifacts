One of the most challenging problems we face in neuroscience is to understand how 
the cortex performs computations. There is increasing evidence that the power of the 
cortical processing is produced by populations of neurons forming dynamic neuronal 
ensembles. Theoretical proposals and multineuronal experimental studies have revealed 
that ensembles of neurons can form emergent functional units. However, how these 
ensembles are implicated in cortical computations is still a mystery. Although cell 
ensembles have been associated with brain rhythms, the functional interaction remains 
largely unclear. It is still unknown how spatially distributed neuronal activity can be 
temporally integrated to contribute to cortical computations. A theoretical explanation 
integrating spatial and temporal aspects of cortical processing is still lacking. In this 
Hypothesis and Theory article, we propose a new functional theoretical framework to 
explain the computational roles of these ensembles in cortical processing. We suggest 
that complex neural computations underlying cortical processing could be temporally 
discrete and that sensory information would need to be quantized to be computed by 
the cerebral cortex. Accordingly, we propose that cortical processing is produced by the 
computation of discrete spatio-temporal functional units that we have called “Discrete 
Results” (Discrete Results Hypothesis). This hypothesis represents a novel functional 
mechanism by which information processing is computed in the cortex. Furthermore, 
we propose that precise dynamic sequences of “Discrete Results” is the mechanism 
used by the cortex to extract, code, memorize and transmit neural information. The novel 
“Discrete Results” concept has the ability to match the spatial and temporal aspects of 
cortical processing. We discuss the possible neural underpinnings of these functional 
computational units and describe the empirical evidence supporting our hypothesis. 
We propose that fast-spiking (FS) interneuron may be a key element in our hypothesis 
providing the basis for this computation.

Discrete Results Hypothesis 
There is increasing evidence that the power of the cortical 
processing is produced by populations of neurons forming 
dynamic neuronal ensembles. Theoretical proposals (Lorente 
de Nó, 1938; Hebb, 1949; Hopfield, 1982; Engel et al., 2001; 
Buzsáki, 2010; Yuste, 2015) and multineuronal experimental 
studies (Fujisawa et al., 2008; Miller et al., 2014) have revealed 
that ensembles of neurons can form emergent functional 
units. However, it is still unknown how distributed neuronal 
activity can be functionally integrated to contribute to cortical 
computations. Moreover, no one knows what these functional 
units look like, or how they emerge. In sum, how these 
ensembles are implicated in cortical computations is still a 
mystery. 
Although cell ensembles have been associated with brain 
rhythms, the functional interaction remains largely unclear. It is 
still unknown how spatially distributed neuronal activity can be 
temporally integrated to contribute to cortical computations. A 
theoretical explanation integrating spatial and temporal aspects 
of cortical processing is still lacking. 
In this Hypothesis and Theory article, we propose a new 
functional theoretical framework to explain the computational 
roles of these ensembles in cortical processing. We suggest that 
complex neural computations underlying cortical processing 
could be temporally discrete. Accordingly, we propose that 
cortical processing is produced by the computation of discrete 
spatio-temporal functional units that we have called ‘‘Discrete 
Results’’ (Discrete Results Hypothesis). Furthermore, we propose 
that precise dynamic sequences of Discrete Results is the 
mechanism used by the cortex to extract, code, memorize and 
transmit neural information. 
As we describe in the next sections, this proposal has 
the ability to match the spatial and temporal aspects of 
cortical processing. Moreover, our hypothesis represents a 
novel functional mechanism by which information processing 
is computed in the cortex. We discuss the possible neural 
underpinnings of this proposal and describe the empirical 
evidence supporting our hypothesis. 
NEURONAL PROCESSING BY 
DISTRIBUTED NEURONAL ACTIVITY 
The power of the cortex lies in the dynamic coordination 
of neurons (Hebb, 1949; Pouget et al., 2000; Yuste, 2015). 
Coordinated activity of large ensembles of spatially distributed 
cells across the cortex provides the source for the processing 
and encoding of sensory information. Experimental work 
supports this idea. Highly distributed representations of tactile 
information have been described in the cortex (Nicolelis et al., 
1997). In the visual cortex, sensory stimuli recruit intrinsically 
generated cortical ensembles (Miller et al., 2014; Okun et al., 
2015). Representation of motor programs via cell ensembles has 
been described (Hommel, 2004). Moreover, the auditory cortex 
is dominated by broad scale dynamics in which a complete 
representation of sounds emerges only at a global scale (Bathellier 
et al., 2012). 
Accordingly, multineuronal recording studies (Fujisawa et al., 
2008; Miller et al., 2014) have revealed that ensembles of neurons 
can form emergent functional units. Therefore, they may be the 
building blocks used in cortical processing. However, important 
questions concerning integration of cortical activity remain 
unresolved. It is still unknown how these ensembles are present 
in the cortex and how spatially distributed cells can functionally 
contribute to unified stimulus codification. Moreover, although 
cell ensembles have long been thought to be associated with 
brain rhythms (Harris et al., 2003), a theoretical explanation 
integrating spatial and temporal aspects of cortical processing has 
yet to be proposed. 
RHYTHMIC NEURONAL ACTIVITY IN THE 
BRAIN 
Mammalian brain activity is rich in rhythms. The preservation 
of that rhythmic activity during the course of evolution 
demonstrates its relevance and appears to reflect a common 
functional mechanism for neural processing (Buzsáki and 
Draguhn, 2004). These rhythms are involved in perception, 
attention, memory, consciousness and movement execution 
(Gray et al., 1989; Engel et al., 2001; Fries et al., 2001; Brown, 
2007; Buschman and Miller, 2010; Baldauf and Desimone, 2014). 
They play a key role in neural communication (Fries, 2005; 
Schroeder and Lakatos, 2009; Siegel et al., 2012). Moreover, it 
has been suggested that oscillatory activity contributes to spike 
synchronization of distributed neurons (Gray et al., 1989; Nuñez 
et al., 1992; Engel et al., 2001) and that synchrony underlies 
binding of separate features enabling perceptual unity (Singer 
and Gray, 1995). 
Excitation and inhibition play a key role in the generation 
of rhythmic activity (Steriade et al., 1993; Whittington et al., 
1995; Traub et al., 1996; Cardin et al., 2009). However, the 
mechanisms underlying oscillations and synchrony are still 
not well understood. Furthermore, current theories about their 
computational role are incomplete (Thiele and Stoner, 2003; 
Roelfsema et al., 2004; Hermes et al., 2015). It remains unclear 
what function they play in neural processing. They may 
contribute to discretize the computation. 
DISCRETE NEURAL COMPUTATION 
The brain receives a constant flow of analog sensory information 
from the environment. Successful interaction with the world 
depends on accurate processing of that information. Therefore, 
the challenging task that the brain faces is to rapidly extract 
changing relevant features from the environment in order to 
respond adequately. It requires a precise detection of changes 
sampling the flow of sensory information to compare its 
contents. Consequently, a primary function of the brain could 
be to discretize the continuous flow of information, compare 
those sampled units and extract relevant information from 
that computation (Figure 1). In sum, although the brain 
receives a constant flow of analog sensory information from 
the environment, sensory stimuli changes will be sampled in a 
discrete manner. 
Scientists have long theorized that our cognition operates 
discontinuously within a framework of discrete cycles

FIGURE 1 | Discrete neural processing. Successful interaction with the world depends on accurate processing of rapidly changing stimuli. It requires a precise 
detection of changes sampling the ﬂow of sensory information to compare its contents. Of particular interest are relevant events, such as the appearance of a 
predator. A challenge faced by the prey’s brain is to rapidly extract predator changing features from the scene in order to react satisfactorily. In this hypothetical 
example, the prey’s visual system actively samples the visual environment. Discrete samples are taken separately by brief temporal periods. Predator movements 
(choosing between the prey and the ball) can be detected by computing differences between the subsamples (see “Cortical Neural Computation by Discrete Results 
Hypothesis: Functional Spatio-Temporal Units of Computation” Section). That computation allows the prey to know if the predator is approaching or leaving and to 
take appropriate action. 
(Pitts and McCulloch, 1947; Harter, 1967; Allport, 1968; 
Varela et al., 1981; VanRullen and Koch, 2003; Buschman 
and Miller, 2010). Accordingly, neural systems could undergo 
oscillatory activity patterns. These oscillations could divide the 
neural processing into a series of discrete computational events. 
There are relevant experimental data demonstrating this 
discrete processing. Discrete computations are well described 
in visual perception (VanRullen et al., 2005). One example 
is microsaccadic eye movements by which the visual system 
acquires fine spatial detail (Ko et al., 2010). Accordingly, 
vision is interrupted and sensory processing is discretized, 
separating it into distinct epochs. Recent evidence has been 
shown for discrete perceptual sampling in the somatosensory 
domain (Baumgarten et al., 2015). They demonstrated that 
somatosensory perception operates in a discrete mode, with 
sensory input being sampled by discrete perceptual cycles. 
Memory (Lundqvist et al., 2016) and attention are other 
examples of this computational nature (Buschman and Miller, 
2009; Busch and VanRullen, 2010). It is known that oscillatory 
neuronal activity in the frontal eye field reflects the successive 
cycles of a sequential attentional exploration process during 
visual search (Buschman and Miller, 2009). Furthermore, 
discretized processing and encoding in the hippocampus is 
well described (Buzsáki, 2005). However, how the brain, 
especially the cerebral cortex, performs this computation is 
unknown.

Discrete Results Hypothesis 
CORTICAL NEURAL COMPUTATION BY 
DISCRETE RESULTS HYPOTHESIS: 
FUNCTIONAL SPATIO-TEMPORAL UNITS 
OF COMPUTATION 
One of the most challenging problems we face in neuroscience 
is to understand how the cortex performs computations. Here 
we suggest that complex neural computations underlying cortical 
processing could be temporally discrete. But how does the 
cortex perform this computation? We propose that cortical 
processing is produced by the computation of discrete emergent 
functional units that we have called Discrete Results (Discrete 
Results Hypothesis). As we describe in the next sections, 
this novel concept has the ability to match the spatial and 
temporal aspects of cortical processing. We discuss the possible 
neural underpinnings of these spatio-temporal computational 
units and describe the empirical evidence supporting our 
hypothesis. 
Our Discrete Results Hypothesis suggests that the 
computational principle of the cortex lies in the precise 
temporal coordination of spikes of spatially distributed neurons. 
It is necessary to divide the temporal and spatial dimension of 
that proposal for a better clarification. 
Spatial Dimension of Cortical Processing: 
The “Ensemble” as a Functional Spatial 
Unit 
In the cortex, most neuronal activity occurs in the form of 
coactive groups of cells defining neuronal ensembles (Miller 
et al., 2014). However, it is unclear how they emerge, with which 
neurons, what and how the relation is between the members, 
what spatial and temporal extension they have and what exactly 
an ensemble functionally means. 
In our hypothesis, we define ‘‘Ensemble’’ as a specific 
spatially distributed set of excitatory neurons (referred to 
as pyramidal cells hereafter, PCs) that are controlled by a 
definite synchronized network of fast-spiking (FS) inhibitory 
cells (see ‘‘Neural Underpinnings of Discrete Results Hypothesis : 
Spatio-Temporal Integration By Fast-Spiking Cells Synchronized 
Network.’’ Section). All PCs organized by that particular 
synchronized inhibitory network form part of that Ensemble. It 
means that the Ensemble is formed by all the PCs whose firing 
could be transiently constrained by that specific synchronized 
inhibitory network (Figure 2). The members and spatial 
extension of the Ensemble is determined by that inhibitory 
network. Moreover, individual PCs could participate in different 
emergent Ensembles. 
These emergent clusters of PCs form functional spatial units 
of cortical computation. However, that spatial aspect must be 
complemented with a temporal one. 
Temporal Dimension of Cortical Processing: 
“Temporal Structure of Spikes” 
Neurons are temporally precise on very fine timescales (Mainen 
and Sejnowski, 1995; Shmiel et al., 2005; Butts et al., 2007). 
Experimental evidence indicates that the exact time point at 
FIGURE 2 | Spatial functional units of cortical processing. A speciﬁc 
spatially distributed set of pyramidal cells (PCs; in orange) that are controlled 
by a speciﬁc coupled network of fast-spiking (FS) inhibitory cells (in red) form 
functional spatial units (“Ensembles”) of cortical computation (in green). All 
PCs organized by that particular inhibitory network form part of that 
Ensemble. Individual PCs could participate in different Ensembles. The 
members and spatial extension of the Ensemble is determined by the 
inhibitory network. Red lines represent mutual connections between FS 
inhibitory cells in the network. These neurons innervate strategically the PCs 
(blue lines) extending a blanket of precise inhibition onto them. 
which a spike occurs plays an important role in information 
processing (Markram et al., 1997). Moreover, the precise timing 
of neuronal spiking is vital for coding of information (Singer 
and Gray, 1995). Therefore, this temporal precision is likely 
to be crucial for cortical computation. However, the functional 
significance remains unclear. 
The Discrete Results hypothesis suggests that cortical 
processing is produced by a highly ordered temporal 
organization. Spike timing of PCs in a particular Ensemble 
is constrained by an inhibitory network generating a precise 
structured firing. We propose that this network constrains 
PCs spikes in temporal precise manner creating what we have 
called ‘‘Temporal Structure of Spikes’’ (Figure 3). We defined 
it as the accurate spike timing organization resulting from the 
precise temporal suppression of PCs spikes in the Ensemble. 
Spikes from PCs occur independently but organized inside the 
temporal structure. We propose that this Temporal Structure 
of Spikes is very important in the processing, coding and 
transfer of information in the cerebral cortex. The temporally 
structured firing activity enables information to be processed 
and coded in a way that downstream networks can compute. 
Accordingly, the existence of this specific temporal structure 
implies that failures in that precision of spikes will result 
in processing dysfunctions. An example of the importance 
of the temporal structure is the spike-timing-dependent 
plasticity (Caporale and Dan, 2008). This temporal structure 
is not fixed. It can be dynamically adjusted (for example 
by sensory input or by top-down influence) to meet the 
finest processing resolution depending on perceptual, task 
or attentional demands. Furthermore, the structure could be 
adjusted by neuromodulators. Accordingly, variations in the 
temporal structure will produce changes in the rate and temporal

Discrete Results Hypothesis 
FIGURE 3 | Temporal structure of spikes. Spike timing of PCs is constrained by FS inhibitory interneurons. These cells set the timing and rate of action potentials 
produced by PCs limiting the temporal window during which they can be generated (Pouille and Scanziani, 2001). Moreover, PCs cannot discharge when they are 
shunted by strong inhibition. Consequently, the synchronized spiking of the inhibitory network creates temporal order among the PCs ﬁring, generating precise silent 
periods that we have called “Silent Gaps” during which action potentials cannot be generated (vertical columns in purple). Rhythmic inhibition of the interneuron 
network provides alternating periods of spiking and no spiking in the Ensemble of PCs constraining these spikes into discrete periods generating a scaffold that we 
have called “Temporal Structure of Spikes”. Rows represent hypothetical spike rasters for an Ensemble of four PCs. Spikes from these PCs occur independently but 
organized inside that temporal structure (top). These cycles would result in the oscillations observed in the brain (bottom left). The temporal structure can be 
dynamically adjusted to meet the ﬁnest processing resolution depending on perceptual, task or attentional demands (bottom right). 
precision of PCs firing in the Ensemble. PCs spikes latencies 
and synchronization between them will vary accordingly. 
Consequently, changes in that temporal precision will code 
different content. 
Experimental data provide support for this proposal. It is 
known that spike timing of PCs is constrained by the inhibitory 
cells. FS interneurons quickly limit the temporal window during 
which action potentials can be generated (Pouille and Scanziani, 
2001; Li et al., 2015). Consequently, PCs are more likely to 
fire at precise points in time (Cardin et al., 2009). More 
importantly, PCs cannot discharge when they are shunted by 
strong inhibition. We propose that these precise inhibitory inputs 
to PCs generate strict periods of no spiking (‘‘Silent Gaps’’) 
in the Ensemble. Our hypothesis suggests that these precise 
Silent Gaps are very important for cortical computation. They 
divide the neural processing in the Ensemble into a series of

Discrete Results Hypothesis 
discrete computational events that we have called ‘‘Discrete 
Results’’. 
It is also known that FS interneurons generate synchronized 
networks by mutual chemical and electrical connections in the 
neocortex (Whittington et al., 1995; Traub et al., 1996; Galarreta 
and Hestrin, 1999; Gibson et al., 1999). Electrical synapses 
generate highly precise transmission between interneurons 
of these networks. We propose that this coupling promotes 
the harmonized firing of connected neurons (Jones et al., 
2000; Deans et al., 2001; Bartos et al., 2007) forming 
a synchronized network imposing a time-dependent spike 
restriction in the Ensemble of PCs. Different synchronized 
networks of FS interneurons create different sets of possible 
Ensembles. The simultaneous firing of the FS interneurons in the 
inhibitory network generates a synchronized inhibitory activity 
at their postsynaptic PCs in the Ensemble. The synchronized 
spiking of the inhibitory network could be fast enough to 
adjust the onset spiking of PCs (Woodruff et al., 2011; Li 
et al., 2015) and to create a temporal structure or scaffold 
providing alternating windows of no spiking in the emergent 
Ensemble of PCs. The rhythmic functioning of this network 
creates a sequence of temporal discrete events. This network 
rhythmically concentrates PCs discharges to particular discrete 
moments providing observable oscillation cycles at population 
level. 
In sum, the inhibitory network forms a spatial structure of 
synchronized FS inhibitory cells and then this synchronized 
network generates a temporal structure of firing in the Ensemble. 
DISCRETE RESULT: A FUNCTIONAL 
SPATIO-TEMPORAL UNIT OF 
COMPUTATION 
Spatio-temporal activity patterns play an important role in 
cortical mechanisms of information processing (Ayzenshtat 
et al., 2010). Consequently, we propose that PCs compute 
and communicate information by using specific spatio-temporal 
patterns of spiking. Our hypothesis suggests that the cortex 
generates and employs these precise patterns to perform 
its computations. Thus cortical processing depends on the 
precise temporally structured relations among the respective 
spikes of PCs of the Ensemble. Information is encoded in 
the precise relations between temporal structured discharges. 
Individual spikes of PCs in the Ensemble take functional 
relevance when inserted into that temporal structure, forming 
a Discrete Result. Precise silent periods (Silent Gaps) inside 
the structure discretize the processing and allow for the 
formation of these discrete spatio-temporal functional units. 
All PCs belonging to the same Ensemble participate in the 
Discrete Result. Therefore, all PCs in the Ensemble have the 
opportunity to fire. Spikes from these PCs occur independently 
but organized inside the temporal structure. Each Discrete 
Result emerges transiently formed by the combination of 
the firing and silent responses (no firing) of all PCs in 
the Ensemble (Figure 4). Thus, PCs silent responses are 
also important in cortical computation and codification. The 
same Ensemble can form multiple Discrete Results. This 
FIGURE 4 | Discrete Results: neural computational units. PCs belonging to the same Ensemble participate in the Discrete Result. Therefore, all PCs in the 
Ensemble have the opportunity to ﬁre. Spikes from these PCs occur independently but organized inside the temporal structure. Each potential Discrete Result 
emerges transiently formed by the combination of the ﬁring and silent responses (no ﬁring) of all PCs in the Ensemble. Therefore, PCs silent responses are also 
important in cortical computation and codiﬁcation. Moreover, the same Ensemble can form multiple Discrete Results. This means that the same PCs of the Ensemble 
process and encode multitude of contents. Consequently, there are great potential neural possibilities that could form a Discrete Result and also enormous 
possibilities that could form different sequences of Discrete Results. In this hypothetical example, the Ensemble is formed by seven PCs and the synchronized 
network of FS interneurons by three cells. Five possible Discrete Results are shown. PCs spikes are displayed as green dots and silent responses (no spikes) as red 
dots. On the right, a digital (binary) representation of these hypothetical Discrete Results is shown.

Discrete Results Hypothesis 
means that the same PCs of the Ensemble, process and 
encode multitude of contents. Consequently, there are great 
potential neural possibilities that could form a Discrete Result 
and also enormous possibilities that could form different 
sequences of Discrete Results. Therefore, the number of 
possible representations that can be formed is titanic. This 
mechanism could explain why the cortex is so robust to 
damage. Moreover, the content coded by a Discrete Result 
depends also on the resolution of the Temporal Structure of 
Spikes. 
Individual PCs could participate in different Ensembles 
and be potentially implicated in multiple representations. 
Furthermore, different synchronized networks of FS 
interneurons create different sets of possible Ensembles. 
Accordingly, the cortex performs computations using multiple 
Ensembles in parallel creating a multitude of Discrete 
Results simultaneously. Moreover, different sets of possible 
Ensembles are created by different synchronized networks 
of FS interneurons along the cortical processing hierarchy. 
Discrete Results at higher levels integrate computational 
results from previous stages. Therefore, each Discrete Result 
constitutes a functional unit that has the ability to process, 
integrate and represent specific content (Discrete Results) from 
previous computations (Figure 5). Consequently, in sensory 
FIGURE 5 | Discrete Results: functional units of neural computational integration. Different sets of possible Ensembles are created by different synchronized 
networks of FS cells along the cortical processing hierarchy. Experimental studies support this idea. Distinct clusters of FS interneurons have been identiﬁed in the 
cortex. For example, in the rat barrel cortex, one layer 4 FS interneuron type has an axonal domain strictly conﬁned to a barrel (Koelbl et al., 2015). Accordingly, the 
cortex performs computations using multiple Ensembles in parallel creating a multitude of Discrete Results simultaneously. Discrete Results at higher levels integrate 
computational results from previous stages. Therefore, each Discrete Result constitutes a functional unit that has the ability to process, integrate and represent 
speciﬁc content (Discrete Results) from previous computations. Consequently, in sensory processing, they functionally contribute to uniﬁed stimulus codiﬁcation. 
Therefore, the Discrete Result concept could explain the binding of separate features enabling perceptual unity. Experimental data provide support for this proposal. 
Highly distributed representations of tactile information have been described in the cortex (Nicolelis et al., 1997). Moreover, the auditory cortex is dominated by broad 
scale dynamics in which a complete representation of sounds emerges only at a global scale (Bathellier et al., 2012).

processing, they functionally contribute to unified stimulus 
codification. 
The Discrete Result concept has the ability to explain how 
complex neural computations underlying cortical processing 
could be temporally discrete. Consequently, we propose 
that sensory information would need to be quantized to 
be computed by the cerebral cortex. Therefore, processing 
of sensory information must be temporally discrete and 
information flow in the cortex must be quantized allowing 
for the formation of Discrete Results. Therefore, in sensory 
processing, they can be defined as each neural computational 
functional unit resulting in quantization of the continuous flow 
of sensory information (Figure 6). Increasing the number 
of Discrete Results per temporal unit allows resolution 
enhancement. It could be dynamically adjusted by sensory 
input or by top-down influence to meet the finest processing 
resolution depending on perceptual, task or attentional 
demands. 
NEURAL COMPUTATION BY DYNAMIC 
SEQUENCE OF DISCRETE RESULTS 
Multineuronal activity structured in temporal sequences has 
been suggested since long ago (Lorente de Nó, 1938; Hebb, 
FIGURE 6 | Discrete Results in cortical sensory processing. 
Hypothetical spatial maps of cortical neurons for each computational event 
resulting in quantization of the continuous ﬂow of sensory information are 
shown. Green cells show a representative Ensemble of PCs organized by a 
speciﬁc synchronized network of FS interneurons. Individual spikes of these 
PCs take functional relevance inserted into a temporal structure forming 
discrete spatiotemporal functional units (Discrete Results). In this hypothetical 
example, relevant sensory information (predator movements) can be extracted 
by computing differences between the Discrete Results. Increasing the 
number of Discrete Results per temporal unit allows resolution enhancement. 
1949; Abeles, 1991). Experimental studies have increased our 
knowledge about how this sequential activity is generated in the 
brain (Harris et al., 2003). However, untangling its functional 
computational significance is still a formidable challenge today. 
We propose that precise sequences of Discrete Results are the 
mechanism used by the cortex to perform computations. The 
computation of the Discrete Results sequence is the mechanism 
used by the cortex to extract, code, memorize and transmit neural 
information. This proposal is a neuronal population mechanism 
to compute and code. Dynamic sequences of Discrete Results 
generate representations. Different sequences codify different 
contents. 
The rhythmic functioning of the synchronized inhibitory 
network creates a sequence of Discrete Results (Figure 7). 
Computations between successive Discrete Results in the 
sequence produce the power of the cortical processing. 
Experimental data provide support for this hypothesis. 
Sequential activity of multineuronal spiking has been well 
described in the cortex (Fujisawa et al., 2008; Crowe et al., 
2010; Harvey et al., 2012; Carrillo-Reid et al., 2015) and in the 
hippocampus (O’Keefe and Burgess, 1996; Fyhn et al., 2004; 
Foster and Wilson, 2006; Pastalkova et al., 2008; Wikenheiser 
and Redish, 2015). 
Moreover, cortical processing by dynamic sequences of 
Discrete Results could be the neural source of some rhythmic 
signals observed at population level. This hypothesis of neural 
processing could be applied to other structures and nuclei of the 
brain.

Our Discrete Results hypothesis suggests that complex 
neural computations underlying cortical processing could 
be temporally discrete. Moreover, we propose that cortical 
processing is produced by the computation of discrete 
spatio-temporal functional units. But what could be the 
neuronal elements underlining this computation? The 
cerebral cortex is composed of many types of neurons. 
Although all of them play a key role in cortical processing, 
our hypothesis suggests that there must be a specific type 
of inhibitory cell that may be implicated in the creation 
of a spatio-temporal structure supporting discrete cortical 
computation. We propose that FS interneuron may be 
a key element in our hypothesis providing the basis for 
this computation. These cells forming a synchronized 
spatially distributed cortical network may impose a 
temporal spike restriction in PCs creating functionally 
coupled units of computation. Their rhythmic activity 
may create a sequence of spatio-temporal functional 
units (Discrete Results), discretizing the information 
processing. In sum, we propose that they are able to

the predator approaching and the other leaving. By computing the successive Discrete Results in the sequence the prey’s cortex is allowed to extract predator 
trajectory in order to respond appropriately. 
integrate the spatial and temporal dimension of cortical 
computation. 
FS cells (Kawaguchi and Kubota, 1997) are the largest 
population of interneurons in the neocortex. They play a key role 
as pacemakers for oscillations (Whittington et al., 1995; Traub 
et al., 1996) and in shaping multineuronal activity (Cardin et al., 
2009). However, it is still unclear how these cells functionally 
contribute to the operations performed by the cortex. 
It is known that they form dense matrices covering PCs 
(Packer and Yuste, 2011) extending a blanket of inhibition 
onto them (Karnani et al., 2014). They strategically innervate 
the axon initial segment (chandelier cells) or soma/proximal 
(basket cells) dendrites of PCs (Klausberger and Somogyi, 
2008). They shape the precise timing and dynamic range of 
action potentials produced by PCs (Pouille and Scanziani, 
2001; Cardin et al., 2009; Sohal et al., 2009; Li et al., 2015). 
They generate synchronized networks by mutual chemical and 
electrical connections (Galarreta and Hestrin, 1999; Gibson 
et al., 1999; Sohal et al., 2009). Accordingly, they fire in 
high synchrony (Jones et al., 2000) at high-frequency firing 
pattern without a significant spike adaptation (Kawaguchi and 
Kubota, 1997). They have narrow spike-waveform, fast kinetics 
(Atallah et al., 2012) and high synchronous release of GABA 
(Hefft and Jonas, 2005). Furthermore, they show broader tuning 
than other neurons (Kerlin et al., 2010; Hofer et al., 2011; 
Li et al., 2015). Thus, in accord with our proposal, these 
properties render them well suited for a structural role in 
cortical processing. Our hypothesis suggests that these cells 
create a temporal structure or scaffold (Temporal Structures 
of Spikes) providing alternating windows of no spiking (Silent 
Gaps) in the emergent Ensemble of PCs. Since different classes 
of FS cells have distinct properties in their temporal pattern 
of discharge (Gupta et al., 2000; Dehorter et al., 2015), it 
is then likely that they create diverse temporal restriction in

Discrete Results Hypothesis 
PCs firing forming different Temporal Structures of Spikes. 
Moreover, we propose that different synchronized networks 
of FS interneurons create different sets of possible Ensembles. 
Experimental work supports this idea. Distinct clusters of FS 
interneurons have been identified in the cortex. For example, 
in the rat barrel cortex, one layer 4 FS interneuron type has 
an axonal domain strictly confined to a barrel (Koelbl et al., 
2015). 
Our hypothesis suggests that precise dynamic sequences 
of Discrete Results is the mechanism used by the cortex to 
extract, code, memorize and transmit neural information 
and that FS cells could play a key role in this discrete 
cortical processing. In agreement with that proposal, these 
cells are essential for perception, cognition, attention, 
memory and behavior (Isomura et al., 2009; Letzkus 
et al., 2011; Yizhar et al., 2011; Courtin et al., 2014; Hu 
et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2016). They are also implicated in 
plasticity and learning (Hensch, 2005; Yazaki-Sugiyama 
et al., 2009; Letzkus et al., 2011; Donato et al., 2013) 
and have been implicated in psychiatric disorders such 
as epilepsy and schizophrenia (Powell et al., 2003; Lewis 
et al., 2012). A prediction of our hypothesis would be that 
silencing of these neurons will disrupt normal cortical 
processing. Recently, it has been shown that silencing of 
these interneurons disrupts attentional processing (Kim 
et al., 2016). Furthermore, our hypothesis suggests that 
discrete cortical processing can be dynamically adjusted 
to meet the finest processing resolution depending on 
perceptual, task or attentional demands. We propose that 
increasing the number of Discrete Results per temporal unit 
allows resolution enhancement. Accordingly, experimental 
data show that perceptual coding and discrimination 
are improved by increased spiking of these cells (Lee 
et al., 2012). Moreover, in agreement with our proposal, 
increases in task difficulty and attentional requirements 
are accompanied by an enhancement of FS cells firing 
(Chen et al., 2008). 
CONCLUSION 
There is increasing evidence that most neuronal activity in the 
cortex occurs in the form of coactive groups of cells defining 
neuronal ensembles. However, it is unclear what exactly an 
ensemble functionally means. These ensembles of neurons can 
form emergent functional units. In this Hypothesis and Theory 
article, we propose a new functional theoretical framework to 
explain the computational roles of these ensembles in cortical 
processing. We suggest that complex neural computations 
underlying cortical processing could be temporally discrete 
and that sensory information would need to be quantized to 
be computed by the cerebral cortex. Accordingly, we propose 
that cortical processing is produced by the computation of 
discrete spatio-temporal functional units that we have called 
Discrete Results. For example, perceptual integration, processing 
resolution and information coding can be now explained by our 
hypothesis. 
The Discrete Result concept explains how complex neural 
computations underlying cortical processing could be temporally 
discrete. This novel concept has the ability to integrate the 
physiological and computational aspects of cortical processing 
defining the traditional idea of cells ensemble limiting their 
spatio-temporal dimension and differentiating their membership 
and relations between the members. Moreover, the Discrete 
Results hypothesis constitutes a conceptual advance with special 
relevance for neuroscience and computer sciences.
