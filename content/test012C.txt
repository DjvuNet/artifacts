Abstract 
Background: The technological revolution in next-generation sequencing has brought unprecedented 
opportunities to study any organism of interest at the genomic or transcriptomic level. Transcriptome assembly 
is a crucial first step for studying the molecular basis of phenotypes of interest using RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq). 
However, the optimal strategy for assembling vast amounts of short RNA-Seq reads remains unresolved, especially 
for organisms without a sequenced genome. This study compared four transcriptome assembly methods, including 
a widely used de novo assembler (Trinity), two transcriptome re-assembly strategies utilizing proteomic and 
genomic resources from closely related species (reference-based re-assembly and TransPS) and a genome-guided 
assembler (Cufflinks). 
Results: These four assembly strategies were compared using a comprehensive transcriptomic database of Aedes 
albopictus, for which a genome sequence has recently been completed. The quality of the various assemblies was 
assessed by the number of contigs generated, contig length distribution, percent paired-end read mapping, and 
gene model representation via BLASTX. Our results reveal that de novo assembly generates a similar number of 
gene models relative to genome-guided assembly with a fragmented reference, but produces the highest level 
of redundancy and requires the most computational power. Using a closely related reference genome to guide 
transcriptome assembly can generate biased contig sequences. Increasing the number of reads used in the 
transcriptome assembly tends to increase the redundancy within the assembly and decrease both median contig 
length and percent identity between contigs and reference protein sequences. 
Conclusions: This study provides general guidance for transcriptome assembly of RNA-Seq data from organisms 
with or without a sequenced genome. The optimal transcriptome assembly strategy will depend upon the 
subsequent downstream analyses. However, our results emphasize the efficacy of de novo assembly, which can 
be as effective as genome-guided assembly when the reference genome assembly is fragmented. If a genome 
assembly and sufficient computational resources are available, it can be beneficial to combine de novo and 
genome-guided assemblies. Caution should be taken when using a closely related reference genome to guide 
transcriptome assembly. The quantity of read pairs used in the transcriptome assembly does not necessarily 
correlate with the quality of the assembly.

Background 
The use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technolo- 
gies has been increasing dramatically over the past 
decade [1]. Due to the technological revolution in NGS, 
vast amounts of both transcriptome and genome 
sequences across a wide range of species are accumulat- 
ing, especially from large-scale projects including 
Genome 10 K [2] and Insect 5 K [3]. Traditionally, 
model organisms have been chosen largely based on the 
ease with which they can be reared in the laboratory and 
used for genetic studies, or their evolutionary relatedness 
to human. However, in the current “-omics” era, a much 
greater variety of organisms can be studied at the 
genomic and transcriptomic level. This revolution in 
DNA sequencing technologies has far-reaching applica- 
tions for the field of biology, dramatically increasing 
opportunities to elucidate gene regulatory networks [4] 
and the genetic basis of complex traits [5, 6]. Most 
importantly, NGS allows scientists to investigate bio- 
logical questions at an unprecedented scale. An excep- 
tional example is a phylogenomic analysis of the origin 
and diversification of major insect lineages using tran- 
scriptome sequencing and genomic data [7]. In this 
study, 103 species from all 33 extant insect orders have 
been sequenced. Combining genomic data from 41 
arthropod species with transcriptomic data from 103 
species, the analysis was able to resolve with high confi- 
dence the timing of the origin and diversification 
(topology) of insects [7], addressing a fundamental ques- 
tion regarding the history of life on Earth. 
RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) is one important NGS 
technology [8]. RNA-Seq samples the entire transcrip- 
tome in great depth under a particular experimental 
condition. The transcriptome includes all expressed 
sequences, which is a reduced representation of the 
genome. RNA-Seq has many exciting applications [8, 9], 
including the phylogenomic example mentioned above, 
single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) discovery, small 
RNA profiling, novel transcript or splice variant discov- 
ery and comparison of global transcriptional mRNA pro- 
files under distinct environmental conditions, e.g., 
benign vs. ecologically stressful conditions. RNA-Seq is a 
powerful tool to advance these applications for at least 
three reasons. First, RNA-Seq is able to capture the 
expression of (ideally) all genes under the specific 
experimental conditions. Second, it does not require any 
prior genetic information, which is well suited for non- 
model organisms. Third, RNA-Seq is cost-effective and 
affordable for most laboratories. For nearly all applica- 
tions of RNA-Seq, transcriptome assembly is challenging 
but a crucial first step for accurate downstream genetic 
analyses [10]. 
De novo transcriptome assembly programs, which 
assemble short RNA-Seq reads without a reference, are 
the default choice for organisms without a genome 
sequence. De novo assembly is particularly suitable for 
non-model organisms, but can also be a useful assembly 
strategy for organisms with a genome sequence. This is 
because de novo assembly programs are not constrained 
by alignments to a reference genome and can therefore 
discover novel transcripts and splice variants that are 
not annotated in the genome [10]. However, de novo 
assembly is usually memory intensive, and requires high 
sequence coverage compared with reference-based 
assembly [10]. In addition, de novo methods tend to 
produce fragmented assemblies. Genomic resources 
from closely related species, including genomic scaffolds 
and protein sequences, can serve as a reference to guide 
transcriptome assembly for non-model organisms and 
may lead to less fragmented assemblies. Therefore, 
transcriptome assembly for non-model organisms can 
potentially benefit from genomic resources of a closely 
related species, as previously demonstrated [11–14]. Due 
to the ever-expanding pool of organisms with a 
sequenced genome, many researchers studying non- 
model organisms without a genome sequence but with 
intriguing ecological, evolutionary and public health 
attributes will soon find closely related genomic 
resources available. 
Without a genome sequence for the species of interest 
(true for most organisms), genomic resources (protein 
sequences and/or genomic scaffolds) from a closely 
related species, if available, can serve as reference scaf- 
folds to re-align de novo assembled contigs. For this 
purpose, our laboratory has developed reference-based 
re-assembly [12, 13], which is based on Scaffolding using 
Translation Mapping (STM) [11]. STM aligns de novo 
assembled contigs to protein sequences from a closely 
related species, and subsequently re-assembles the 
contigs according to the alignment results [11]. STM has 
been demonstrated to reduce redundancy and improve 
contig length relative to de novo assembly [11]. 
Reference-based re-assembly is modified from STM as a 
two-step process to incorporate both protein sequences 
and genomic scaffolds from a closely related species, 
which utilizes not only the protein coding sequences, 
but also genomic sequences including 5′ and 3′ un- 
translated regions as well as other non-coding regions 
[12, 13]. Reference-based re-assembly has been shown to 
improve de novo assembly by increasing contig length 
and reducing redundancy [12, 13, 15]. Another similar 
approach to STM is Transcriptome Post-Scaffolding 
(TransPS) [14], which also utilizes protein sequences 
from a closely related species in order to re-assemble 
the de novo contigs according to how they align to the 
reference protein sequences. In contrast to reference- 
based re-assembly, TransPS merges contigs with non- 
overlapping alignments to the same reference protein

[14]. However, TransPS does not utilize genomic se- 
quences from a closely related species. TransPS reduces 
the number of contigs to as few as 10 % of the number 
of de novo assembled contigs, eliminating contigs that 
are redundant and increasing coverage for the reference 
protein sequences relative to the de novo assembly [14]. 
An alternative method that has been proposed to 
improve transcriptome assembly is genome-guided 
assembly, which utilizes the genome sequence of the 
same species as a reference to guide the transcriptome 
assembly [16]. If a high quality reference genome is 
available, this method usually generates longer contigs 
and is much less computationally demanding than de 
novo assembly [10]. With a well-annotated genome 
sequence, genome-guided assembly has been demon- 
strated to outperform de novo assembly [17]. If the 
genome assembly from the species of interest is not well 
annotated, and a well-annotated genome assembly from 
a closely related species is available, researchers may 
utilize the closely related genome to guide transcriptome 
assembly. However, few studies have evaluated the 
efficacy and accuracy of this approach (but see [18]). 
The optimal strategy for transcriptome assembly will 
depend upon the downstream analysis and computa- 
tional resources available. Data associated with extensive 
transcriptome sequencing in Ae. albopictus provide an 
outstanding opportunity to evaluate multiple methods of 
transcriptome assembly. Rich transcriptomic resources 
have been established across multiple life stages for Ae. 
albopictus, including developing embryos [12], pharate 
larvae [13, 19] and adults [15]. Therefore, the vast 
majority of all the expressed genes in the genome are 
included in these data. Furthermore, a closely related 
species, Aedes aegypti, has a well-annotated genome 
[20], which provides protein and genomic reference 
scaffolds for improving de novo transcriptome assembly 
with reference-based re-assembly and TransPS methods. 
In addition, a draft genome sequence for Ae. albopictus 
has recently been published [21], which allows for a 
genome-guided assembly. Finally, the more completely 
assembled and annotated Ae. aegypti genome assembly 
provides an excellent opportunity to evaluate the efficacy 
and accuracy of using a closely related reference genome 
to guide transcriptome assembly. 
No study has thus far compared de novo assembly with 
both transcriptome re-assembly via protein reference scaf- 
folding (i.e., reference-based re-assembly and TransPS) and 
genome-guided assembly simultaneously. This study 
utilized a comprehensive transcriptomic database of Ae. 
albopictus to investigate the optimal transcriptome 
assembly strategy, comparing four assembly methods: a) de 
novo assembly using Trinity [22, 23], b) reference-based re- 
assembly using proteomic and genomic resources from Ae. 
aegypti, c) TransPS [14] using the Ae. aegypti proteome 
and d) genome-guided assembly by Cufflinks [24] using 
the recently sequenced Ae. albopictus genome and the 
well-annotated Ae. aegypti genome. The quality of the 
various assemblies was assessed by the number of contigs 
generated, contig length distribution, percent paired-end 
read mapping, and gene model representation via BLASTX 
[25]. We also examined differences between the gene 
models identified by each assembly strategy to determine 
whether unique subsets of gene models were identified by 
each method. In addition, we examined how the amount 
of data (number of sequence reads) affected these quality 
metrics of the assembly. Results from this study are 
particularly relevant to non-model organisms with 
genomic resources from a closely related species. Further- 
more, the genome assembly of Ae. albopictus is fragmented 
due in part to its large size (1.9 Gb) and high composition 
(68 %) of repetitive elements [21]. However, this assembly 
is comparable to other published insect genomes [3], and 
therefore results from this study can be extended to emer- 
ging model organisms with a more fragmented genome 
assembly compared to traditional model organisms. 
Methods 
RNA-Seq data 
Cleaned RNA-Seq paired-end reads from pooled tissue 
samples described in previous publications from this 
laboratory were used for this study. These data include 
reads from developing embryos [12], pharate larvae [13, 
19] and adults [15] of Ae. albopictus under diapause and 
non-diapause conditions (read length = 101 bp). General 
procedures for generating these RNA-Seq reads from Ae. 
albopictus have been described previously [26]. Quality 
filtering of the RNA-Seq raw reads was consistent across 
studies and described in detail in previous publications 
from this laboratory [12, 13, 15]. 122,687,107 cleaned 
read pairs were obtained from the developing embryos, 
289,860,821 cleaned read pairs were obtained from the 
pharate larvae and 182,036,362 cleaned read pairs were 
obtained from the adult stage. In order to investigate the 
effect of data quantity on the quality of the assembled 
transcriptome, read pairs from the three life stages (em- 
bryo, larva, adult) were partitioned into three datasets 
containing increasing number of read pairs. We included 
reads from all three life stages in each dataset to 
maximize representation of expressed genes in the 
analysis. The smallest dataset, termed 180 M, was 
comprised of 181,225,819 read pairs, taken from one 
biological replicate from all experimental treatments 
(diapause vs. non-diapause) in each life stage. In cases 
where the libraries had been sequenced on different 
runs, the largest libraries from one lane in each run were 
included. The amount of data in the 180 M dataset is 
the yield of approximately two lanes of Illumina HiSeq 
2000 sequencing. The medium dataset, termed 360 M,

/*** Page =3= ***/
was comprised of 344,799,731 read pairs, taken from the 
remaining biological replicates of each treatment and life 
stage. The amount of data in the 360 M dataset is the 
yield of approximately four lanes of Illumina HiSeq 2000 
sequencing. The largest dataset, termed 600 M, was 
comprised of 594,584,290 read pairs, taken from all 
sequencing lanes and runs across all treatments and life 
stages. The amount of data in the 600 M dataset is the 
yield of approximately seven lanes of Illumina HiSeq 
2000 sequencing. The transcriptome assembly strategies 
utilized in this study and described below were applied 
to all three datasets (Fig. 1). 
Transcriptome assembly strategies 
De novo assembly 
Trinity ([23]; version 20140717) was used for de novo 
assembly. Reads were in silico normalized with the 
option –normalize_max_read_cov 100 (based on recom- 
mendations in Haas et al. [23]). In addition, –min_- 
kmer_cov 2 and –min_contig_length 200 were used to 
reduce memory footprint and discard contigs shorter 
than 200 bp, respectively. In all other respects, default 
parameters were used. After Trinity assembly, redundant 
contigs with over 99 % identity were eliminated using 
CD-HIT-EST [27, 28]. 
Fig. 1 Flow chart for the experimental design of this study. Three datasets, 180 M, 360 M and 600 M, were used for each of the four assembly 
strategies described in the text. Subsequently, all fourteen assemblies were assessed by the metrics contig number and length distribution, 
percent paired-end reads mapped back to the assembly and gene model representation. De novo stands for de novo assembly, Ref-based for 
reference-based re-assembly, TransPS for transcriptome post-scaffolding, and G. guided for genome-guided assembly

Reference-based re-assembly 
After de novo assembly by Trinity, reference-based re- 
assembly was performed as described in detail in previous 
publications [12, 13, 15]. The annotated Ae. aegypti protein 
sequences (AaegL3.3, accessed on October 8, 2014 from 
VectorBase [29]) were used as the protein reference for the 
reference-based re-assembly, in order to provide a consist- 
ent comparison with TransPS. The Ae. aegypti genome 
scaffolds (AaegL3) and gene annotations (AaegL3.3.gff3) 
used as the genomic reference were downloaded from 
Vectorbase [29]. Custom Perl scripts for reference-based 
re-assembly are available upon request. 
Transcriptome Post-Scaffolding (TransPS) 
After de novo assembly by Trinity, TransPS re-assembly 
[14] was performed using default parameters according to 
the authors’ instructions. The Ae. aegypti proteome was 
selected as the scaffolding reference, because Ae. aegypti is

sAe. albopictus and 
the most closely related species with well-documented gen- 
omic information. Because TransPS is developed for the as- 
sembly of strand-specific RNA libraries (Z. Adelman, pers. 
comm.), contigs in the reverse complement orientation to 
the protein references were first transformed to the same 
orientation as the protein references based on BLASTX 
results. All correctly oriented contigs were then searched 
against the protein references using BLASTX. Contigs that 
matched the protein references (e-value < 1e-06) were re- 
assembled by TransPS using default parameters. 
Genome-guided assembly - Ae. albopictus reference genome 
The genome assembly of Ae. albopictus [21] was used as 
the genomic reference. This assembly is comprised of 
~400,000 scaffolds, with an N50 of ~200 kb [21]. The 
Tuxedo suite [24], including Bowtie, Tophat and Cuf- 
flinks, was used for genome-guided assembly. For each 
dataset, reads from distinct life stages were first separately 
mapped to the genome by Tophat (–segment-length 50 
–no-coverage-search), to minimize the frequencies of 
SNPs and computational power required [24]. Mapped 
reads were assembled by Cufflinks (-u -I 500000), and 
subsequently merged by Cuffmerge. The default parame- 
ters were used except in cases specified in parentheses 
above. To be consistent with the other assembly strategies, 
only contigs longer than 200 bp were retained. After 
genome-guided assembly, redundant contigs with over 
99 % identity were eliminated using CD-HIT-EST [27, 28]. 
Genome-guided assembly - Ae. aegypti reference genome 
Using the 180 M dataset, the genome assembly of Ae. 
aegypti [20] was used as the genomic reference. This 
assembly is comprised of 4,757 scaffolds, with an N50 of 
~1.5 Mb (AaegL3, Vectorbase). The Tuxedo suite [24], 
including Bowtie, Tophat and Cufflinks, was used for 
genome-guided assembly. Reads from distinct life stages 
were first separately mapped to the genome by Tophat 
using recommended procedures (–segment-length 50 –no- 
coverage-search), assembled by Cufflinks (-u -I 500000), 
and subsequently merged by Cuffmerge. A reference anno- 
tation file for Ae. aegypti (AaegL3.3, Vectorbase) was incor- 
porated into Cuffmerge (-g < reference_annotation.gtf>) to 
guide the assemblies, as researchers would likely take 
advantage of the existing annotations. Cuffmerge was also 
performed without reference annotation. The default pa- 
rameters were used except in cases specified in parentheses 
above. To be consistent with the other assembly strategies, 
only contigs longer than 200 bp were retained. After 
genome-guided assembly, redundant contigs with over 
99 % identity were eliminated using CD-HIT-EST [27, 28]. 
Comparison between genome-guided assemblies using two 
reference genomes 
Using the 180 M dataset, genome-guided assemblies using 
the Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti (with reference annota- 
tion) genomes were aligned to both Ae. albopictus and Ae. 
aegypti genomic scaffolds via BLASTN (evalue < 1e-6). 
Custom Perl scripts were used to calculate percent iden- 
tity and contig coverage from the alignment results. 
Quality metrics 
Contig number and length distribution 
Fewer and longer contigs lead to more accurate and 
efficient downstream read mapping. This will in turn 
optimize subsequent genetic analyses, such as differen- 
tial gene expression analysis, SNP calling, and novel 
transcript or splice variant discovery. The number of 
contigs generated by each assembly method was re- 
corded and the contig length distribution was repre- 
sented by the median contig length. All contigs from de 
novo assemblies (180 M, 360 M, 600 M datasets) were 
aligned against the Ae. aegypti gene models with and 
without multiple isoforms using BLASTX (evalue < 1e- 
6). Contigs with greater than or equal to 70 % identity to 
the gene models and all isoforms were counted and 
aggregated for each dataset (180 M, 360 M, 600 M). 
Unannotated contigs from the reference-based re- 
assemblies were aligned to the Ae. albopictus genomic 
scaffolds using BLASTN (evalue < 1e-6). Custom Perl 
scripts were used to calculate percent identity, alignment 
length and contig coverage. 
Read mapping 
A high percentage of reads mapping back to the tran- 
scriptome assembly is desirable for accurate downstream 
analyses, such as differential gene expression analysis, 
SNP calling, and novel transcript or splice variant 
discovery. This is because more reads mapped back to 
the assembly will result in increased statistical power for

performing these analyses. Paired-end reads from each 
dataset and assembly method were mapped back to the 
corresponding assembly using Bowtie 2 ([30]; with -N 1 
and insert length range specified). The percentage of 
total reads that mapped back and reads that uniquely 
mapped back to the assemblies was recorded. 
Gene model representation 
Measures of gene model representation described below 
include the number of gene models identified in the 
transcriptome, percent identity between the contigs and 
reference gene models, and percent reference coverage 
by the contigs. 
Number of gene models 
A higher number of gene models represented in the 
transcriptome assembly provides a basis for more com- 
prehensive analysis of the transcriptome under a certain 
experimental condition. To test the representation of 
gene models by the transcriptome assemblies, contigs 
were aligned using BLASTX to the Ae. aegypti proteome 
(AaegL3.3). To provide a second benchmark and 
minimize potential bias towards reference-based re- 
assembly and TransPS, the assemblies were also aligned 
using BLASTX to a non-redundant dipteran protein ref- 
erence set. This dipteran protein reference set was gen- 
erated by downloading orthologous protein sequences 
from Ae. aegypti, Culex quinquefasciatus, Anopheles 
gambiae and Drosophila melanogaster from OrthoDB 
[31], Version 7 (accessed on October 2, 2014), with one 
single ortholog retained per ortholog group in the order 
specified above (i.e., order of relatedness to Ae. albopic- 
tus). The final reference set contained 19,272 protein 
sequences, and represented a wide range of evolutionary 
diversity within Diptera with little redundancy. The best 
BLASTX matches with e-value smaller than 1e-6 were 
retained (sorted by bitscore and e-value). Custom Perl 
scripts were used to calculate the number of unique 
gene models represented in the transcriptome assem- 
blies. In order to identify putative orthologs, reciprocal 
BLAST was performed for assemblies using the 180 M 
dataset against the Ae. aegypti protein reference set. 
Assemblies were searched against the reference set using 
BLASTX (evalue < 1e-6) and the reference set was 
searched against the assemblies using TBLASTN (evalue 
< 1e-6). The reference gene model identified as the best 
match for a contig by BLASTX was designated as a 
reciprocal best hit (RBH), a potential ortholog, if the 
contig was identified as the best match for the gene 
model by TBLASTN. We didn’t include contigs from 
the genome-guided assembly using the Ae. aegypti refer- 
ence genome because of its bias towards the Ae. aegypti 
genomic scaffolds (see Additional file 1 and results 
below). We performed reciprocal BLAST for assemblies 
using the 180 M dataset against the Ae. aegypti protein 
reference set because we have found that the 180 M 
dataset is adequate for downstream transcriptome 
analyses (see Results below), and the Ae. aegypti and 
dipteran protein reference sets yield similar results (see 
Figs. 3 & 4, Table 1 and Additional files 2 & 3).

ware environment (www.r-project.org). Genome-guided 
assembly using the Ae. aegypti reference genome was not 
included in this analysis because of the above-mentioned 
bias. The 360 M and 600 M datasets were not used in this 
analysis because each assembly method generated similar 
numbers of gene models across all three datasets (180 M, 
360 M, 600 M) for each of the two reference protein sets 
(see Results below). The unique gene models identified by 
de novo and genome-guided assemblies were tested for 
enrichment of specific Gene Ontology (GO) terms and 
KEGG pathways using the Bioconductor GOseq package 
[32] in R. GO terms for the dipteran gene models were 
obtained from Ensembl Metazoa [33]. KEGG pathway 
assignments for the dipteran organisms in the two refer- 
ence protein sets were obtained from KEGG API [34]. 
Because GO terms and KEGG pathways only correspond 
to genes rather than specific isoforms, isoforms were 
consolidated within each gene model in the enrichment 
analyses. 
Percent identity 
A higher median percent identity (PID) indicates higher 
confidence in annotating the Ae. albopictus contigs as 
putative orthologs of the reference gene models, which 
is important for interpreting downstream analyses. Cus- 
tom Perl scripts were used to calculate the PID between 
contigs and their best BLASTX matches. 
Reference coverage 
A high coverage of the reference gene models by assem- 
bled contigs indicates that the annotated gene models 
are well represented in the Ae. albopictus transcriptome, 
which leads to high confidence in accurate subsequent 
genetic analyses. Custom Perl scripts were used to calcu- 
late the percent coverage for the protein reference in 
each match (i.e., the proportion of the reference repre- 
sented in a match). 
Results 
Due to the substantial computational requirements of 
performing transcriptome assembly with some of the 
methods considered in this study and the large RNA-Seq 
datasets we analzyed, it was only feasible to perform one 
assembly for each method and dataset. Therefore, we 
discuss the absolute magnitude of clear differences and/or 
high similarities between the assembly methods and 
between datasets (180 M, 360 M, 600 M) within assembly 
methods. 
Contig number 
Consistently across all three datasets, de novo assembly 
produced the largest numbers of contigs, followed 
closely by reference-based re-assembly. Genome-guided 
assembly using the Ae. albopictus reference genome 
produced less than half the number of contigs produced 
by de novo assembly. Genome-guided assembly using 
the 180 M dataset and the Ae. aegypti genome produced 
similar number of contigs relative to TransPS, but fewer 
than other assembly methods (Table 1). TransPS 
produced the smallest numbers of contigs, with over 
87 % reduction in the number of contigs relative to de 
novo assembly (Table 1). Consistently across all assembly 
strategies performed using three datasets, increasing the 
amount of input read pairs used in the transcriptome 
assembly led to an almost two-fold increase in the num- 
ber of contigs generated, except for TransPS, where the 
increase was minimal (Table 1). The number of contigs 
aligned to annotated gene models and isoforms did not 
increase substantially with increasing number of read 
pairs in the datasets (see Additional file 4). More than 
84 % of the unannotated contigs aligned to the Ae. 
albopictus genomic scaffolds, with high median percent 
identity (~93 %) and contig coverage (>97 %) by the 
genomic scaffolds, though with short median alignment 
length (255–258 bp, see Additional file 4). 
Contig length distribution 
With reference annotation, genome-guided assembly 
using the Ae. aegypti genome generated contigs longer 
than any other assembly method, except for TransPS 
(Table 1). Without reference annotation, genome-guided 
assembly using the Ae. aegypti reference genome gener- 
ated the shortest contigs (Table 1). Consistently across 
three datasets among all other assembly methods, de novo 
assembly and reference-based re-assembly generated simi- 
lar and the smallest median contig lengths. Genome- 
guided assembly using the Ae. albopictus reference 
genome generated median contig lengths more than twice 
as long as those by de novo assembly and reference-based 
re-assembly. Finally, the TransPS assembly generated the 
greatest median contig length with a more than four-fold 
increase relative to de novo assembly and reference-based 
re-assembly (Table 1). Within each assembly strategy 
performed using three datasets, increasing the amount of 
read pairs used in the transcriptome assembly slightly 
decreased the median contig length, with the exception of 
TransPS, which generated slightly greater median contig 
lengths with more input read pairs (Table 1). 
Paired-end read mapping 
Consistently across all three datasets, de novo assembly, 
reference-based re-assembly and genome-guided assem- 
bly using the Ae. albopictus reference genome produced 
a similar percentage of paired-end reads mapped back, 
ranging from 84.73 to 93.06 % (Fig. 2). Less than 80 % of 
the paired-end reads mapped back to the TransPS

assemblies (Fig. 2). Genome-guided assembly using the 
Ae. aegypti reference genome had the lowest percentage 
of reads mapped back (<40 %, Fig. 2). When considering 
uniquely mapped reads, de novo assembly and reference- 
based re-assembly had a similar percentage of reads 
uniquely mapped back and TransPS had a slightly higher 
percentage of reads uniquely mapped back (all above 
70 %, see Additional file 5). Genome-guided assembly 
using the Ae. albopictus reference genome had a much 
lower percentage of reads uniquely mapped back 
(<50 %) and genome-guided assembly using the Ae. 
aegypti reference genome had the lowest percentage of 
reads uniquely mapped back (<8 %, see Additional file 
5). Within each assembly strategy performed using three 
datasets, increasing the amount of read pairs used in the 
transcriptome assembly did not have a large or consist- 
ent effect on the read mapping percentage. 
Number of gene models 
For all datasets, most assemblies produced similar 
numbers of gene models from both Ae. aegypti and 
dipteran protein reference sets (see Fig. 3 and Additional 
file 2), with the number of dipteran gene models gener- 
ated by TransPS assemblies slightly lower than the other 
methods (~8,500 vs. >9,100). The exceptions were that 
genome-guided assembly using the Ae. aegypti reference 
genome with reference annotation produced the highest 
numbers of both Ae. aegypti and dipteran gene models 
and that genome-guided assembly using the Ae. aegypti 
reference genome without reference annotation 
produced the lowest numbers of both Ae. aegypti and 
dipteran gene models (see Fig. 3 and Additional file 2). 
Within each assembly strategy performed using three 
datasets, increasing the amount of input read pairs led 
to a very slight increase in the number of Ae. aegypti 
gene models represented in the assembly (~200, Fig. 3), 
although increased input read pairs did not have an 
apparent effect on the number of dipteran gene models 
represented in the assembly (see Additional file 2). The 
number of gene models discovered from the dipteran 
protein reference set was smaller than that from the Ae. 
aegypti protein reference set, which is expected due to 
the closer relationship of Ae. albopictus to Ae. aegypti 
relative to the other species in the dipteran protein refer- 
ence set. Using the 180 M dataset, TransPS generated 
the highest percentage of RBHs, and the largest number 
of potential orthologs, amongst all assembly methods, the 
rest of which performed similarly (see Additional file 6). 
Genome-guided assembly using the Ae. albopictus refer- 
ence genome had the highest median alignment length 
when searched against the Ae. aegypti protein reference 
set (see Additional file 6). The protein reference set had 
the highest median alignment length when searched 
against the TransPS assembly (see Additional file 6). 
Using the 180 M dataset, reference-based re-assembly 
and TransPS identified the same subsets of gene models 
identified by de novo assembly, with very few exceptions 
(see Fig. 4 and Additional file 3). This result is expected 
because these two methods are both re-assembly strategies 
performed after de novo assembly. Also using the 180 M 
dataset, the de novo assembly and genome-guided assembly 
using the Ae. albopictus reference genome identified 1,375 
and 988 unique gene models relative to each other from 
the Ae. aegypti reference protein set, respectively (Fig. 4).

Finally, the de novo assembly and genome-guided assembly 
using the Ae. albopictus reference genome identified 1,036 
and 935 unique gene models relative to each other from 
the dipteran reference protein set, respectively, using the 
180 M dataset (see Additional file 3). In all cases, the 
unique gene models were not enriched for specific GO 
terms or KEGG pathways (all FDR-corrected p values are 
greater than or equal to 0.11). 
Percent identity 
Genome-guided assembly using the Ae. aegypti reference 
genome generated contigs with the perfect (100 %) median 
percent identity (PID) to corresponding Ae. aegypti and 
dipteran gene models (Table 1). Consistently across three 
datasets among all other assembly methods, TransPS 
generated contigs with the highest median PID to corre- 
sponding Ae. aegypti and dipteran gene models, followed 
closely by reference-based re-assembly, de novo assembly 
and genome-guided assembly using the Ae. albopictus ref- 
erence genome, the latter three with similar PID values 
(Table 1). Within each assembly strategy performed using 
three datasets, increasing the amount of read pairs used in 
the transcriptome assembly decreased median PID to both 
Ae. aegypti and dipteran gene models. 
Reference coverage 
Median reference coverage by Ae. albopictus contigs for 
both Ae. aegypti and dipteran gene models was high 
(most above 97.50 %) and similar across most transcrip- 
tome assembly strategies using each dataset (Table 1). 
Genome-guided assembly using the Ae. aegypti reference 
genome with reference annotation produced the highest 
median reference coverage (100 %). The exception was 
that genome-guided assembly using the Ae. aegypti ref- 
erence genome without reference annotation produced 
the lowest median reference coverage (below 50 %). 
Genome-guided assembly - Ae. albopictus genome versus 
Ae. aegypti genome 
Contigs from the genome-guided assembly using the Ae. 
albopictus reference genome resembled the Ae. albopictus 
genomic scaffolds (median percent identity = 100 %, 
median contig coverage = 100 %), rather than the Ae. 
aegypti genomic scaffolds (median percent identity = 
78.34 %, median contig coverage = 76.02 %, see Additional 
file 1A). On the contrary, with reference annotation, 
contigs from the genome-guided assembly using the Ae. 
aegypti reference genome resembled the Ae. aegypti 
genomic scaffolds (median percent identity = 100 %, 
median contig coverage = 100 %), rather than the Ae.

albopictus genomic scaffolds (median percent identity = 
80.68 %, median contig coverage = 86.90 %, see Additional 
file 1B). This result likely indicates the presence of ances- 
tral polymorphism in the Ae. albopictus genome after 71.4 
million years of divergence from Ae. aegypti [21] and 
emphasizes the limitation of using a closely related refer- 
ence genome for guiding transcriptome assembly with the 
Tuxedo suite workflow. 
Discussion 
Transcriptome assembly is a crucial first step for tran- 
scriptome analyses using RNA-Seq data. With the rapid 
development in the NGS technologies, genomic and tran- 
scriptomic resources have accumulated rapidly for a wide 
range of organisms. However, deciding on the optimal 
transcriptome assembly strategy for non-model organisms 
remains a challenge, especially with the large amount of 
data generated by NGS. This study is the first to compare 
de novo assembly with genome-guided assembly, 
reference-based re-assembly and TransPS, the latter two 
methods representing transcriptome re-assembly using 
protein sequences from closely related species. This study 
is also one of the first to compare genome-guided assem- 
bly using a reference genome from the focal study organ- 
ism and a reference genome from a closely related species. 
Our analysis takes advantage of three datasets with 
increasing numbers of Illumina paired-end reads. 
A previous study [35] used genomic contigs from the 
same species or genomic scaffolds from a closely related 
species (90–95 % identity) as a scaffold to re-assemble 
de novo contigs generated from RNA-Seq reads. Results 
from this study [35] showed that genomic sequences 
from the same species or closely related species can 
improve the representation of full-length reference tran- 
scripts by the de novo transcriptome assembly. However, 
high coverage genomic sequences are often not available 
together with RNA-Seq reads, as high coverage whole 
genome sequencing is still expensive, especially for 
species with a large genome. In addition, genomic re- 
sources from closely related species with higher than 
90 % identity are relatively rare. In contrast, this study 
used protein sequences from a more distantly related 
species (Ae. aegypti, in the same sub-genus, Stegomyia, 
as Ae. albopictus) as the reference scaffolds. This study 
also considered genomic scaffolds from Ae. aegypti with 
80–85 % identity at the nucleotide level relative to the 
comparison noted above. Thus, both re-assembly ap- 
proaches used in this study (reference-based re-assembly 
and TransPS) are likely to apply to a wide range of 
organisms. Although the optimal assembly strategy will 
depend upon the purpose and downstream analyses of 
the specific study, our analysis provides general guidance 
that is likely to be useful to researchers conducting tran- 
scriptome analyses in non-model organisms. 
De novo assembly - Trinity 
Trinity, which has been optimized for runtime perform- 
ance [36], has been demonstrated to be an effective de 
novo transcriptome assembler [23, 37, 38]. Trinity de 
novo assembly performed similarly to genome-guided as- 
sembly using the Ae. albopictus reference genome in 
terms of percent read mapping back to the assembly and 
gene model representation, though not in terms of con- 
tig number or length distribution. One of the advantages 
of de novo assembly is that gene models can be assem- 
bled that may not be assembled by a genome-guided 
method if the reads cannot be mapped back to the 
current genomic scaffolds due to improper scaffold 
assembly (see Fig. 4 and Additional file 3). It is straight- 
forward and fast (24–48 h) to perform the Trinity 
assembly pipeline using high quality RNA-Seq reads, 
though it typically requires a large amount of memory 
(up to 256GB of RAM in this study). Thus, Trinity will 
usually require a high performance computing cluster or 
the cloud environment. Trinity incorporates all reads 
simultaneously without the need to separately perform 
assemblies of reads from different life stages or environ- 
mental conditions. The assemblies generated by the 
Trinity de novo method had high read mapping percent- 
age, and represented a substantial number of gene 
models with high median PID and coverage. Identifying 
more total gene models, including paralogs, can be more 
beneficial for downstream differential gene expression 
and enrichment analyses, because most paralogs have 
similar biological functions and are included in gene 
ontology and KEGG pathways. Trinity assemblies had 
slightly lower unique mapping rates than TransPS 
assemblies, but because read mapping programs, such as 
RSEM [39], take into account reads mapped to multiple 
gene models, total read mapping rates are more inform- 
ative than unique mapping rates for most downstream 
analyses. Therefore, the Trinity assemblies would be 
suitable for subsequent differential gene expression 
analysis, SNP discovery in coding regions, and also novel 
transcript or splice variant discovery. However, the Trin- 
ity assemblies contain more redundancy relative to 
assemblies generated by genome-guided and TransPS 
methods. Redundant contigs represent highly similar se- 
quences corresponding to the same reference and are in 
part due to the fact that RNA-Seq was performed on 
mRNAs from tissue samples that were pooled from 
multiple individuals, a common practice in RNA-Seq 
studies. The increased redundancy of the Trinity ass- 
emblies is reflected in the larger number of contigs, but 
similar number and coverage of reference gene models 
relative to the other assembly methods. The redundancy 
within the de novo assembly increased with increasing 
amount of input read pairs, primarily due to the increase in 
unannotated rather than annotated contigs (see Additional 
Huang et al. BMC Genomics (2016) 17:523

/*** End Page =9= ***/
/*** Page =10= ***/
file 4). These unannotated contigs align to unannotated 
protein coding sequences and non-coding sequences, 
including 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions. 
Reference-based re-assembly 
Our previous study [15] has demonstrated that reference- 
based re-assembly can improve de novo assembly in terms 
of contig number and length distribution. However, in the 
current study, reference-based re-assembly performed 
similarly to de novo assembly using Trinity (Table 1). 
There are two likely reasons for this result. First, different 
versions of Trinity were used in the previous and the 
current studies, and the latter is an improved version. 
Second, our previous study only used short RNA-Seq 
reads from the adult stage for the de novo assembly, which 
were then combined with previous contigs from other life 
stages in a reference-based re-assembly, including contigs 
assembled from 454 sequencing reads. However, the 
current study assembled short Illumina RNA-Seq reads 
from all life stages into a de novo assembly. The contigs 
from this de novo assembly were then used in the 
reference-based re-assembly, but were not combined with 
any previously assembled contigs. The advantage of 
reference-based re-assembly is that it can combine contigs 
from previous studies under different environmental con- 
ditions using different sequencing platforms [12, 13, 15], 
which makes the re-assembly less computationally 
demanding and more flexible. Furthermore, reference- 
based re-assembly can incorporate both protein and 
genomic sequences from closely related species, maximiz- 
ing the information provided by reference scaffolding. 
However, reference-based re-assembly is more compli- 
cated to perform than the straightforward Trinity de novo 
assembly pipeline because it involves using several custom 
Perl scripts for the re-assembly, generally taking approxi- 
mately 2 weeks to complete after de novo assembly. 
TransPS 
In the current study, we used a reference proteome from 
Ae. aegypti. As mentioned above, Ae. aegypti is in the 
same sub-genus (Stegomyia)a 
sAe. albopictus. This is 
similar to the level of divergence between one of the 
organisms (Ixodes ricinus) and its reference (I. scapu- 
laris) used in the original study [14]. TransPS reduced 
the number of contigs by more than 87 %, a result simi- 
lar to the original description of this method [14]. 
TransPS also produced the longest contigs with more 
than a four-fold increase in the median contig length 
relative to de novo assembly and reference-based re- 
assembly (Table 1), with minimal redundancy. Thus, the 
TransPS assemblies had the lowest number of contigs 
per gene model among all four assembly methods. 
Moreover, the median coverage for reference gene 
models by TransPS assemblies was the highest amongst 
all methods (>99 %), except for the genome-guided 
assembly using the Ae. aegypti genome with reference 
annotation (Table 1), indicating that TransPS assemblies 
had almost complete representation for the reference 
coding sequences. TransPS assembly also had the 
highest percentage of reciprocal best hits (RBHs, see 
Additional file 6). Out of 17,158 Ae. aegypti gene 
models, 3,952 are at least 70 % identical to other gene 
models (not isoforms), with median percent identity of 
97.88 % and median coverage of 99.65 %. Because 
TransPS generated the longest contigs (Table 1) by also 
merging contigs with non-overlapping alignments to the 
same gene model, the TransPS contigs can better dis- 
tinguish small differences between highly similar gene 
models, thereby identifying the most RBHs (see 
Additional file 6). This advantage is reflected in the 
longest median alignment length when searching the 
reference set against the assemblies (TBLASTN), not 
when searching the assemblies against the reference set 
(BLASTX, see Additional file 6). However, the overall 
number of gene models and read mapping percentage of 
the TransPS assemblies were slightly lower than the 
other three strategies, which could limit some down- 
stream analyses such as differential gene expression ana- 
lysis, SNP discovery, or novel transcript and splice variant 
discovery. This result is likely due to the algorithm used 
by TransPS to re-assemble the de novo assembly via 
protein sequences from a closely related species, without 
the untranslated regions or non-coding sequences in the 
genomic scaffolds utilized by the reference-based re- 
assembly or genome-guided assembly. On the other hand, 
because TransPS had the highest percentage of reads 
uniquely mapped back, which enables accurate identifica- 
tion of orthologs, TransPS may be preferable for other 
downstream analyses, such as phylogenomic studies. A 
few thousand complete and orthologous genes from each 
transcriptome will be sufficient to construct a phylogeny 
with high confidence (e.g., [7]). Identifying the largest 
number of potential orthologs via reciprocal BLAST fur- 
ther strengthens the advantage of using TransPS for phy- 
logenomic studies. As described in the Methods section, 
TransPS is developed specifically for assembly of strand- 
specific libraries, and therefore extra steps are required if 
the initial assembly (prior to scaffold re-assembly) is 
generated from non-strand-specific sequencing reads. 
While the TransPS script took an hour to finish, generat- 
ing the necessary BLASTX outputs and the extra steps 
necessary to handle non-strand-specific sequencing reads 
took approximately 2 weeks to complete. 
Genome-guided assembly - Cufflinks: Ae. albopictus 
reference genome

albopictus reference genome were very similar to those 
produced by de novo assembly and reference-based re- 
assembly. However, genome-guided assemblies using the 
Ae. albopictus reference genome produced less than half 
of the number of contigs generated by de novo assembly 
and reference-based re-assembly (Table 1), indicating 
that this assembly produced lower redundancy relative 
to these two methods. In addition, genome-guided 
assemblies using the Ae. albopictus reference genome 
produced median contig lengths more than twice as long 
as those produced by de novo assembly and reference- 
based re-assembly (Table 1). Furthermore, genome- 
guided assembly is much less computationally demand- 
ing than de novo assembly. Genome-guided assembly 
using Cufflinks requires the most computational 
resources during read mapping to the genome. In this 
study, up to 72GB of RAM was used for the read 
mapping using TopHat and up to 36GB of RAM was 
used for the Cufflinks genome-guided assembly. It took 
approximately 1 week to complete read mapping and 
assembly using the pipeline. Another advantage of 
genome-guided assembly is that transcripts with low 
sequencing coverage can be assembled if the reads can 
be mapped to the genomic scaffolds, which can lead to 
unique gene models assembled relative to de novo 
assembly (see Fig. 4 and Additional file 3). However, 
genome-guided assembly using the Ae. albopictus refer- 
ence genome performed similarly to those generated by 
de novo assembly and reference-based re-assembly in 
terms of percent read mapping back to the assembly and 
gene model representation, and had the lowest unique 
mapping rates. This is likely because of the fact that the 
current Ae. albopictus genome assembly is relatively 
fragmented, largely due to its huge genome size and high 
composition of repetitive elements in the genome [21]. 
However, the fragmented assembly of the Ae. albopictus 
genome (~400,000 scaffolds with an N50 of ~200 kb) is 
similar to other insect genomes. For example, the sand 
fly genome, Phlebotomus papatasi, has 106,826 scaffolds 
with an N50 of 27,956 bp [3]. Therefore, our current 
results are likely relevant to a wide range of organisms 
with similarly fragmented genome assemblies. Genome- 
guided assemblies can be suitable for differential gene 
expression analysis and SNP discovery, but may be less 
desirable for novel transcript and splice variant discov- 
ery, because only reads aligned to the known splice junc- 
tions can be assembled. 
Genome-guided assembly - Cufflinks: Ae. aegypti 
reference genome 
Ae. aegypti is a closely related species in the same sub- 
genus (Stegomyia)asAe. albopictus. Ae. aegypti has well- 
annotated genomic resources and a much less fragmented 
genome assembly, which helps to identify more complete 
gene models (see Fig. 3 and Additional file 2). However, 
using the Ae. aegypti rather than the more fragmented Ae. 
albopictus genome to guide transcriptome assembly can 
be problematic. Genome-guided assembly using the Ae. 
aegypti reference genome produced contigs that resemble 
the Ae. aegypti genomic scaffolds, rather than the Ae. 
albopictus genomic scaffolds (see Additional file 1). This 
result is reflected by the low percentage of reads mapped 
back, perfect median percent identity and reference cover- 
age values of contigs from the genome-guided assembly 
using the Ae. aegypti genome with reference annotation 
(see Table 1 and Additional file 5). 
Combination of de novo and genome-guided assemblies 
Assemblies generated by the de novo and genome-guided 
methods identified a small number of unique gene models 
relative to each other, which is consistent with a previous 
study [40]. Therefore, it might be beneficial to combine 
genome-guided and de novo assemblies, as proposed 
previously [10]. When the genome reference is not well 
assembled, de novo assembly should be performed first, 
followed by aligning contigs from the de novo assembly to 
the genome reference in order to extend and scaffold the 
contigs [10]. However, if the annotation of the genome is 
not complete, additional annotation based on orthologs will 
still be necessary. As a proof of concept, we combined de 
novo assembly and genome-guided assembly using the Ae.

Effect of the number of reads on assembly quality 
The quantity of input read pairs increased the redun- 
dancy within the assembly, and decreased both median 
contig length and PID, whereas it did not have a clear ef- 
fect on other quality metrics, i.e., percent read mapping 
and gene model representation. This is likely due to the 
increasing number of mismatches in the larger datasets 
caused by SNPs from the pooled tissue samples and/or 
sequencing errors. These mismatches caused difficulties 
for the assembly programs to consolidate highly similar 
contigs. This in turn increased the number of contigs 
generated (increased redundancy with similar number of 
gene models and reference coverage), and reduced both 
the median contig length and PID. Therefore, it will gen- 
erally be beneficial and cost-effective to use fewer reads 
(i.e., the 180 M dataset). The exception was TransPS, 
which generated slightly longer contigs with more input 
read pairs (Table 1). This is likely because the algorithm 
used in TransPS that assembles contigs that have non-

overlapping matches to the same reference, thereby cre- 
ating longer contigs [14]. 
Conclusions 
Our results emphasize the efficacy of de novo transcrip- 
tome assembly using high quality Illumina RNA-Seq 
reads and the importance of genome assembly and an- 
notation for genome-guided assembly. Despite generat- 
ing a more fragmented transcriptome assembly, de novo 
assembly performed similarly to genome-guided assem- 
bly using the Ae. albopictus reference genome in terms 
of read mapping and gene model representation. With 
high quality reads, de novo assembly can prove to be 
effective for organisms without a genome sequence, or 
for organisms with a fragmented genome assembly 
relative to traditional model organisms. A recent study 
points out that even with well curated human and worm 
genomes, de novo assembly still performs similarly to 
genome-guided assembly in terms of sensitivity in con- 
structing the transcriptome using simulated data [41]. 
Previous studies have demonstrated a better perform- 
ance by genome-guided assembly than de novo assembly 
[17, 35]. However, this study showed that, if the genome 
assembly is fragmented and/or genome annotation is 
incomplete, de novo assembly can perform similarly to 
or even outperform genome-guided assembly in terms 
of read mapping back to the assembly and gene model 
representation. Researchers need to be cautious when 
using a closely related reference genome to guide tran- 
scriptome assembly, because the resulting assembly can 
be biased towards the closely related genome rather than 
the focal genome. In our analysis, this result occurred 
when using a reference genome from the same sub- 
genus with approximately 70 million years of divergence 
(see Additional file 1). Reference-based re-assembly per- 
formed similarly to de novo assembly, whereas TransPS 
generated the longest contigs with higher reference 
coverage, least redundancy and largest number of poten- 
tial orthologs (RBHs). However, TransPS also produced 
assemblies with the lowest percent read mapping and 
number of gene models identified. Our results also 
reveal that the amount of input read pairs tended to 
reduce the quality of the resulting transcriptome assem- 
bly. Thus, 180 M high quality paired-end reads will usu- 
ally be sufficient to generate a transcriptome assembly 
appropriate for downstream analyses. The optimal tran- 
scriptome assembly strategy is dependent upon intended 
downstream analyses, but in general, Trinity de novo 
assembly with 180 M high quality read pairs is suitable 
for most downstream transcriptome analyses, especially 
for organisms without a genome sequence. If a genome 
assembly is present, it can be beneficial to combine de 
novo and genome-guided assemblies when the computa- 
tional resources are available.
