R Ε F A C Ε, IT is not my intention to detain the reader by ex- patiating on the variety, or the importance of the fubjeft, Avhich I have undertaken to treat : fmce the merit of the choice would ferve to render the weak- nefs of the execution ftill more apparent, and ftill lefs excufable. But as I have prefumed to lay before the Public a firfl volume only of the Hiftory of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, it λνίΐΐ per- haps be expefted that I fhould explain, in a few words, the nature and limits of my general plan. The memorable feries of revolutions, which, in the courfe of about thirteen centuries, gradually un- dermined, and at length deftroyed, the folid fabric of Roman greatnefs, may, with fome propriety, be divided into the three following periods. A 2 I. The

iv PREFACE. I. The firft of thcfc periods may be traced from the age of Trajan and the Antonines, when the Ro- man monarchy having attained its full ftrength and maturity, began to verge towards its decHne ; and will extend to the fubverfion of the weftern empire, by the barbarians of Germany and Scythia, the rude anceftors of the mofl: poliihed nations of modern Europe. This extraordinary revolution, which fub- jefted Rome to the power of a Gothic conqueror, was completed about the beginning of the fixth century. II. The iecond period of the Decline and Fall of Rome, may be fuppoied to commence with the reign of Juftinian, who by his laws, as well as by his vic- tories, rcftored a tranfient iplendour to the Eaftern Empire. It will comprehend the invafion of Italy by the Lombards; the conqueft of the Afiatic and African provinces by the Arabs, who embraced the religion of Mahomet ; the revolt of the Roman people againft the feeble princes of Conftantinople; and the eleva- tion of Charlemagne, v/ho, in the year eight hun- dred,

PREFACE. dred, eilabliihed the fecond, or German Empire of the weft. III. The laft and longcft of theie periods includes about feven centuries and a halfj from the revival of the Weftern Empire, till the taking of Conftantino- ple by the Turks, and the extinction of a deg:nerate race of princes, who continued to aiTume the titles of Coefar and Auguftus, after their dominions were contracted to the limits of a fmgle city ; in v/hich the language, as well as manners, of the ancient Romans, had been long fmce forgotten. The writer vv^ho fhould undertake to relate the events of this period, WOuld find himfelf obliged to enter into the general hlftory of the Crufades, as far as they contributed to the ruin of the Greek Empire ; and he would fcarcely be able to reftrain his curiofity from making ibme inquiry into the ftate of the city of Rome, during the darkneis and confufion of the middle ages. As I have ventured perhaps too haftily to commit to the preis, a work, which, in every ienfe of the WOrd,

PREFACE. word, dcfcM'vcs the epithet of imperfe<rt, I con- fider myfclf as contracting an engagement to finiili, moft probably in a fecond volume, the firft of theie memorable periods ; and to deliver to the Public, the complete hiftory of the Decline and Fall of Rome, Jrom the age of the Antonines, to the fubverfion of the Weftern Empire. With regard to the fubiequent periods, though I may entertain fome hopes, I dare not prcfume to give any affurances. The execution •of fuch an extenfive plan, as I have traced out, and which might perhaps be comprehended in about four volumes, would fill up the loiig interval between ancient and modern hiftory ; but it would require many years of health, of leifure, and of perfeve- rance. ntii.'ck-Street, Mav I, 1777. P. S. Before ί difmifs this Third Edition from the Prefs, I think it incumbent on me to declare, that the indulgence of the candid Public encourages me to profecute a laborious Work, which has been judged not wholly unworthy of their attention. 7 
/*** End Page =7= ***/
/*** Page =8= ***/
ADVERTISEMENT. ILIGENGE and accuracy are the only merits which an hiftorical writer may afcribe to himfclf ; if any merit indeed can be aflumed from the performance of an indifpenfable duty. I may therefore be allowed to fay, that I have carefully examined all the original materials that could illuftrate the fubjedl which I had undertaken to treat. Should I ever complete the extenfive defign which has been iketched out in the Preface, I might perhaps- conclude it with a critical account of the authors confulted during the progrefs of the whole work; and however fuch an attempt might incur the cenfure of oftentation, I am perfuaded, that it would be fufceptible of entertainment as well as information. At prefent I ihall content myfelf with a fingle obfervation. The Biographers, who, under the reigns of Diocletian and Conftaniine, compofed, or rather compiled, the lives of the emperors, from Hadrian to the fons of Carus, are ufually mentioned under the names of ^lius Spartianus, Julius Capitolinus, jElius Lampridius, Vulcatius Gallicanus, Trebellius Pollio, Ά\)ά Flavius Vopifcus. But there is fo much perplexity in the titles of the MSS. ; and fo many difputes have arifen among the critics (fee Fabricius Biblioth. Latin. 1. iii. c. 6 ) concerning their number, their names, and their refpedive property, that for the moft part I have quoted them with'• out diftindlion, under the general and well known title of the. Augiifian Hifiory.
