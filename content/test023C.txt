Abstract 
The ability to precisely modify genomes and regulate specific genes will greatly accelerate 
several medical and engineering applications. The CRISPR/Cas9 (Type II) system binds 
and cuts DNA using guide RNAs, though the variables that control its on-target and off-tar- 
get activity remain poorly characterized. Here, we develop and parameterize a system-wide 
biophysical model of Cas9-based genome editing and gene regulation to predict how 
changing guide RNA sequences, DNA superhelical densities, Cas9 and crRNA expression 
levels, organisms and growth conditions, and experimental conditions collectively control 
the dynamics of dCas9-based binding and Cas9-based cleavage at all DNA sites with both 
canonical and non-canonical PAMs. We combine statistical thermodynamics and kinetics 
to model Cas9:crRNA complex formation, diffusion, site selection, reversible R-loop forma- 
tion, and cleavage, using large amounts of structural, biochemical, expression, and next- 
generation sequencing data to determine kinetic parameters and develop free energy mod- 
els. Our results identify DNA supercoiling as a novel mechanism controlling Cas9 binding. 
Using the model, we predict Cas9 off-target binding frequencies across the lambdaphage 
and human genomes, and explain why Cas9’s off-target activity can be so high. With this 
improved understanding, we propose several rules for designing experiments for minimiz- 
ing off-target activity. We also discuss the implications for engineering dCas9-based genetic 
circuits. 
Author Summary 
The CRISPR/Cas9 immunity system has the potential to revolutionize medicine and bio- 
technology by enabling researchers to cut an organism’s genomic DNA at precise loca- 
tions. While Cas9 is perhaps the most versatile and easy-to-use technique for gene therapy 
developed yet, it is not perfect; the enzyme can also cut DNA at unwanted locations in an 
organism’s genome. Cas9’s off-target activity must be greatly minimized to further 
improve its utility. Here, we develop a system-wide, quantitative, physical model to better

understand all the factors that collectively control Cas9’s off-target cleavage. We solve for 
the unknown parameters using gene regulation data from our laboratory as well as struc- 
tural, biochemical, and next-generation sequencing data from other laboratories. Using 
the model in several examples, we explain how Cas9 identifies on-target versus off-target 
DNA sites, depending on the guide RNA sequence, the Cas9 and crRNA expression levels, 
the organism’s genome, and the organism’s cellular growth rate. We then propose several 
rules for designing experiments with minimal off-target activity. 
Introduction 
The RNA-mediated Cas9 adaptive immunity system (CRISPR type II) has revolutionized 
genome engineering by enabling the precision cutting of DNA that can be customized to target 
any sequence [1,2,3,4,5,6], while being functional in a broad range of prokaryotes and eukary- 
otes, including bacteria, yeast, flies, fish, plants, worms, monkeys, mice, rats, rabbits, frogs, and 
human cell lines [3,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18]. By forcing the host to repair these preci- 
sion DNA cuts, the CRISPR/Cas9 system allows recombinant DNA to be inserted at desired 
genome locations, and therefore can be used for performing high-throughput gene knockouts, 
loss-of-function screening, artificial immunization, removal of latent genome-encoded viruses, 
and site-specific gene therapy applications [19,20,21,22]. A nuclease-deficient version of Cas9, 
called dCas9, retains its RNA-guided DNA binding activity and has been used as a transcrip- 
tion factor to tightly control gene expression levels and rewire a host's transcriptional regula- 
tory network [23]. Multiple dCas9-based repression and activation devices, including within 
layered genetic circuits, have been developed in bacteria, yeast, and mammalian cells; these 
genetic circuits can regulate a targeted promoter's transcription rate by up to 1000-fold 
[5,24,25,26,27]. In principle, the expression of multiple guide RNAs, working with dCas9, 
enables the regulation of many promoters simultaneously, and provides an almost limitless 
source of programmable transcription factors. 
Based on recent observations, the CRISPR/Cas9/dCas9 system is highly versatile, but has 
imperfect specificity and activity under a wide range of environmental and genotypic condi- 
tions [25,28,29], motivating a study of its mechanisms and the development of a model to 
rationally design its guide RNAs [21]. One major challenge has been binding to off-target 
DNA sites, resulting in off-target mis-cutting of genomic DNA by Cas9 or gene mis-regulation 
by dCas9 [28,30,31,32,33]. Several strategies have been shown to reduce Cas9 off-target behav- 
ior by manipulating its cleavage activity [33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40]. For example, two guide 
RNAs expressed together with a partially nuclease-deficient Cas9 nickase have been used to 
make two single-strand cuts at adjacent locations, increasing the rate of on-target repair by 
homologous recombination [40]. Further, fusing dCas9 to the FokI nuclease increased the 
specificity of its nuclease activity to a 20 bp recognition sequence [39]. These strategies address 
off-target cutting, but not off-target binding and gene regulation. A system-wide understanding 
of how guide RNAs work together with Cas9/dCas9 to control off- and on-targeting binding 
would enable the rational design of guide RNAs, and other controllable factors, to improve 
Cas9/dCas9 specificity and activity. In particular, when engineering dCas9-based genetic cir- 
cuits, it will be desirable to modulate dCas9's ability to regulate gene expression through the 
introduction of guide RNA mismatches [8]. However, the quantitative relationship between 
guide RNA sequence and dCas9's binding affinity is currently unknown. 
In this work, we develop a comprehensive, mechanistic model of CRISPR/Cas9 that predicts 
how experimental conditions and guide RNA sequences (crRNAs) control target site selection

and cleavage activity. To initially parameterize this model, we analyze the large amount of 
structural, biochemical, and next-generation sequencing data that has recently measured sev- 
eral aspects of CRISPR/Cas9's function with different crRNAs under varied experimental con- 
ditions [4,29,33,35,37,38,41,42,43,44]. We formulate a single system-wide model that explains 
how these disparate observations can originate from the same CRISPR/Cas9 mechanism of 
function. We also present quantitative criteria for designing guide RNA sequences with tar- 
geted binding and cleavage activities. By accounting for several important factors beyond the 
guide RNA sequence, our design rules are a significant improvement over existing, and some- 
what contradictory, sequence design rules whose outcomes have also depended on the selected 
experimental conditions [8,21,33,37,42]. 
To develop this model, we employed statistical thermodynamics and the law of mass action 
to formulate a five-step mechanism that accounts for concentration-dependent, cell volume- 
dependent, host genome-dependent, and crRNA-dependent changes to Cas9 complex forma- 
tion, diffusion, target specificity, and target activity (Fig 1). Kinetic and thermodynamic con- 
stants were estimated by analyzing six studies of Cas9/dCas9 function (Table 1). We validated 
this model using in vitro Cas9-dependent cleavage rate data (Fig 2), obtained by Sternberg 
et al. [38], together with new data collected in this study, measuring in vivo dCas9-dependent 
Fig 1. The multi-step mechanism responsible for Cas9-mediated DNA site cleavage. (A) Each crRNA strand is expressed with rate rcrRNA. The active 
crRNA is formed by either hybridization of an expressed tracrRNA with an expressed precrRNA or by direct expression of a single guide RNA (sgRNA). The 
Cas9 endonuclease is expressed with rate rCas9. (B) Cas9 binds to the mature crRNA with a forward kinetic association constant kf. After loading the crRNA, 
the structure of the Cas9:crRNA undergoes an isomerization with forward kinetic constant kI to create an active complex. NcrRNA,NCas9,Nintermediate, and 
NCas9:crRNA are their numbers of molecules. (C) The resulting active complex performs a 3D random walk with molar flow rate rRW. The probability that it binds 
to a DNA site is determined by the site sequence, including the presence of a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), the number of same-sequence DNA sites 
(Ntarget, j), and their binding free energy ( Gtarget, j). (D) The formation of a stable Cas9:crRNA:DNA complex occurs in several steps: Cas9:crRNA recognizes 
the PAM site, unwinds the DNA duplex, and sequentially replaces DNA:DNA base pairings with RNA:DNA bases pairings in an exchange reaction to form a 
DNA:RNA:DNA complex, called an R-loop. The DNA target site's binding free energy to Cas9:crRNA ( Gtarget) sums together its PAM interaction energy 
( GPAM), the energy needed to unwind the supercoiled DNA ( Gsupercoiling), and the crRNA:DNA exchange energy during R-loop formation ( Gexchange). 
During these steps, the Cas9:crRNA:DNA complex may dissociate with first order kinetic constant kd or it may be cleave the bound DNA site with pseudo first 
order kinetic constant kC. (E) After cleavage, the Cas9:crRNA:DNA complex remains bound to the cleaved DNA, and is considered a no-turnover enzyme. 
Additional model parameters include the DNA replication rate ( ) and the degradation or dilution rates of Cas9 (δCas9), crRNA (δcrRNA), and Cas9:crRNA 
complex (δCas9:crRNA).

the lambda phage genome, mirroring a recent experimental study utilizing DNA curtains, to 
illustrate the differing dynamics between on-target and off-target DNA sites (Fig 5). Finally, we 
applied the model to predict the frequency and location of off-target cleavage sites in a medi- 
cally relevant example, where Cas9 was used to remove latent HIV viral DNA segments from a 
human cell line [45](Fig 6). Finally, by performing a sensitivity analysis on the model, we 
show the optimal experimental conditions to maximize on-target (d)Cas9 activity and mini- 
mize (d)Cas9 off-target binding (Fig 7). 
Results 
A Mechanistic Model of CRISPR/Cas9 
The activity of Cas9-mediated cleavage is dictated by a 5-step mechanism that includes the 
expression of Cas9 and crRNA, the formation of active Cas9:crRNA complex, a random intra- 
cellular walk to search for DNA target sites, the formation of a Cas9:crRNA:DNA complex (an 
R-loop) at DNA sites, and finally DNA site cleavage (Fig 1). We developed a dynamical mecha- 
nistic model that incorporates all known biomolecular interactions and processes that control 
the rates of these steps (Materials and Methods). The mechanistic model accounts for how sev- 
eral factors control all the DNA sites' cleavage rates, including changing Cas9 and crRNA 
expression levels, different crRNA protospacer (guide) sequences, different DNA site 
sequences, both canonical and non-canonical PAM recognition DNA site sequences, and the 
effects of DNA site supercoiling. The model also explicitly accounts for the host's specifications, 
including its genome sequence, genome length, cell size, and growth rate. Moreover, the model 
allows for the expression of multiple crRNA guide strands, and it will determine how the com- 
petitive binding of crRNAs to Cas9 will also affect the DNA sites' cleavage rates. When express- 
ing Cas9, the model calculates the numbers of all free, bound, and cleaved DNA sites that 
contain a canonical or non-canonical PAM site, encoded within the host genome or on plas- 
mids. When expressing nuclease-deficient dCas9, the model calculates the occupancy of stably 
bound dCas9:crRNA complexes to all DNA sites. Overall, the formulated model contained

Model Parameterization Using In Vitro Measurements 
We first utilized the in vitro measurements obtained by Sternberg et. al. to determine the 
kinetic parameter values that quantify Cas9:crRNA complex formation, pre-cleavage dissocia- 
tion, and Cas9-dependent cleavage [38]. In this study, the binding locations and cleavage rates 
of Cas9 using a plasmid DNA substrate were measured to characterize the multi-step process 
by which Cas9 finds DNA targets, initiates R-loop formation, and cleaves DNA sites. Here, we 
utilized the authors' dynamic measurements of DNA site cleavage at different concentrations 
of Cas9 and crRNA, using either an on-target site on plasmid DNA (Fig 2B in [38]) or an on- 
target site on a double-stranded DNA fragment (Extended Data Fig 5 in [38]). We also ana- 
lyzed Cas9’s protein structure and its motility to estimate that Cas9's characteristic length is 
λCas9 150°A [43,46] and its diffusivity in a cytoplasmic-like buffer is 45 m2/s [47]. Therefore, 
we determined that Cas9 performs an isotropic random walk with a diffusive specific flow rate 
of 4.05 x10-10 1/sec. In the presence of 25 nM plasmid DNA, these calculations indicate that a 
Cas9:crRNA complex collides with a DNA site 61 times per second.

We then determined the kinetic parameter values controlling Cas9:crRNA association (kf), 
isomerization (kI), pre-cleavage dissociation (kd), and cleavage activity (kC) by calculating the 
rate of cleavage (rC) across a range of Cas9 and crRNA concentrations, mirroring the experi- 
mental conditions, and comparing to experimental cleavage measurements (56 experiments; 
R2 = 0.97; S1 Fig) using 25 nM plasmid DNA [38]. The model solution was evaluated for an ini- 
tial 10 minute time period, followed by in silico addition of the DNA substrate and an addi- 
tional 30 minute time period. The best-fit kinetic parameter values were then determined 
through optimization to minimize the relative error between calculated and measured cleavage 
rates (Materials and Methods). Based on our analysis (S2 Fig), we could uniquely parameterize 
kf,kI, and the ratio kc/kd (Table 2). Surprisingly, the rate of cleavage was found to be less than 
the rate of pre-cleavage dissociation (kc/kd << 1), suggesting that (d)Cas9 must engage in mul- 
tiple aborted rounds of binding and R-loop formation before successfully cleaving the DNA 
site. Using the best-fit parameter values, the model was able to accurately capture the experi- 
mentally observed time-dependent cleavage rates while varying the Cas9 and crRNA concen- 
trations (Fig 2). The best-fit parameter values are reported in Table 2. 
As expected, when the Cas9 concentration is limiting, the calculated amount of cleaved 
DNA is almost equal to the Cas9 concentration because Cas9 does not turn-over. However, 
when non-supercoiled, short (55 bp) DNA fragments were used as template, Sternberg et. al. 
found that Cas9’s total cleavage activity dropped by 5-fold even though the apparent cleavage 
rate of DNA increased (S3A Fig). The authors hypothesized that the reduced cleavage activity 
originated from a batch of partially active Cas9 enzyme. To test this possibility, we first reduced 
the concentration of Cas9 in silico to 20% of the reported concentration. The model reproduced 
the measured amount of cleaved DNA after the 10 minute incubation period, however, the 
model-calculated rise to steady-state was slower than the experimentally observed rise (S3A 
Fig). Instead, if we also accounted for the much smaller number of DNA sites and the lack of 
negative supercoiling of the short DNA fragments, then the model correctly explains the exper- 
imentally observed fast rise time (S3B and S3C Fig). Specifically, there were 5482 total possible 
DNA sites (N) when plasmid DNA template (2741 bp) was used in the in vitro measurements, 
compared to only 110 possible DNA sites when short DNA fragments were used (55 bp), 
resulting in about 50-fold higher rise time. The difference in DNA site supercoiling partly 
counteracted this much higher model-calculated rise time by requiring an additional 0.43 kcal/ 
efficiency in growing cells. (C) The dynamics of dCas9-based transcriptional repression (promoter activity) at DNA sites with either (blue) zero, (green) one,

When using dCas9 to implement genetic forms of computing, we anticipated the need to intro- 
duce several adjacent crRNA binding sites to differentially regulate gene expression. However, 
according to the biophysics of R-loop formation, it was possible that the binding of a (d)Cas9: 
crRNA complex to one target DNA site could actually lower the affinity of (d)Cas9:crRNA 
complexes to adjacent DNA sites. Specifically, when a dCas9:crRNA complex binds to a DNA 
site, the creation of an R-loop will negatively supercoil the site’s DNA, for example, by untwist- 
ing it. Because DNA’s linking number is conserved, the negative supercoiling of one DNA site 
will increase the positive supercoiling of adjacent DNA sites. According to model Eq 13,a 
higher superhelical density will make it less likely for another dCas9:crRNA complex to bind to 
adjacent DNA sites by requiring a higher free energy input to stably form an R-loop [48]. 
To investigate this effect, we constructed a three plasmid system that expresses dCas9 using 
a constitutive promoter, a single crRNA using an IPTG-inducible PTAC promoter, and a YFP 
reporter protein using a constitutive promoter containing a fully complementary (on-target) 
crRNA binding site (Fig 3A). Using dCas9:crRNA as a transcriptional repressor, we measured 
steady-state YFP expression levels as the transcription rate of the crRNA was steadily increased 
via IPTG induction. We then introduced either one, two, four, or eight additional on-target 
crRNA binding sites at a distal location on the high-copy reporter plasmid, upstream of the 
YFP promoter, separated by a transcriptional terminator, and performed the same YFP fluores- 
cence measurements. These auxiliary on-target crRNA binding sites were separated by 60 to 80 
bp of non-repetitive DNA. The presence of the many additional crRNA binding sites in a non- 
regulatory location had the expected effect of sequestering dCas9:crRNA, resulting in lower 
amounts of transcriptional repression at YFP’s promoter and higher YFP expression levels (Fig 
3B). 
In light of this data, we consider two distinct hypotheses relating the number of artificially 
added crRNA binding sites to the apparent increase in YFP expression level. First, if dCas9-me- 
diated R-loop formation has no effect on the superhelical density of surrounding crRNA bind- 
ing sites, then we should expect that adding more crRNA binding sites will proportionally 
sequester more dCas9:CrRNA, resulting in greater YFP expression levels as more crRNA bind- 
ing sites are added. Second, if dCas9-mediated R-loop formation does increase the supercoiling 
of adjacent DNA sites, then we should expect that many additional crRNA binding sites will 
not proportionally sequester more dCas9:crRNA, resulting in a sub-linear increase in YFP 
expression as more sites are added. To quantify the extent that R-loop formation increases the 
superhelical density of surrounding crRNA binding sites, we added a single parameter to our 
model ( σ). When n copies of dCas9:crRNA are bound to nearby DNA sites, the initial super- 
helical density of the remaining nearby DNA sites is increased by n σ, which increases the 
sites’ Gsupercoiling according to Eq 13, and lowers the probability that they will be bound by 
additional dCas9:crRNA. If σ is zero, model calculations show that adding 8 crRNA binding 
sites to the plasmid will yield greater amounts of dCas9:crRNA sequestration, resulting in 
300-fold more YFP expression (Fig 3B, right). However, if σ is positive, adding more crRNA 
binding sites will yield diminishing amounts of dCas9:crRNA sequestration and sub-linear 
increases in YFP expression (Fig 3B, left). 
Using this data-set to evaluate these two hypotheses, we found that adding 2, 4, or 8 addi- 
tional crRNA binding sites increased dCas9:crRNA sequestration and YFP expression, but

with lower-than-proportional amounts, suggesting that there is indeed a anti-cooperative 
mechanism affecting site occupancies (Fig 3B). We found that a moderate site-to-site superhe- 
lical density penalty ( σ = 0.0065) was sufficient to explain how adding more crRNA binding 
sites sublinearly increased dCas9:crRNA sequestration and YFP expression level (Fig 3B, left) 
with a high degree of confidence (R2 = 0.97, p < 10−8; S4 Fig). The apparent site-to-site changes 
in superhelical density appear to be additive; for dCas9 to stably bind to the 8 binding site 
array, it would be necessary to untwist over 160 bp of the 900 bp region, equivalent to about 6 
kcal/mol of free energy input, which would greatly destabilize R-loop formation and lower 
dCas9:crRNA occupancy. To compare, a model that ignores changes in superhelical density, 
and its effect on dCas9:crRNA occupancy, was not able to explain the measurements (Fig 3B, 
right). Additionally, according to this data-set, it appears that crRNA concentration, and not 
dCas9 concentration, was limiting the total amount of dCas9:crRNA that could bind these 
additional crRNA bind sites or the promoter to repress YFP expression, discounting an alterna- 
tive hypothesis. 
Model Parameterization for Canonical and Non-Canonical PAM Sites 
Cas9 requires the presence of a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence to bind to a DNA 
site, form an R-loop, and cleave DNA. While the consensus PAM sequence for the Cas9 from 
S. pyogenes is NGG, it was previously observed that R-loop formation could take place at non- 
canonical PAM sites, resulting in a considerable amount of off-target activity [3,35,42]. To 
quantify Cas9’s binding free energy to DNA sites that use either canonical and non-canonical 
PAM sites, we utilized data from a recent study that measured Cas9’s cleavage activity when 
bound to DNA sites with identical PAM-proximal sequences, but randomized PAM sequences, 
using a homolog of Cas9 from S. pneumonia [3]. We compared cleavage activities to a reference 
PAM site, which we defined by the four nucleotide sequence 5’-CGGT-3’, with a corresponding 
reference free energy ( GPAM,ref = -9.9 kcal/mol). This reference free energy was consistent 
with our in vivo measurements shown in Fig 3. Importantly, we found that the first nucleotide 
(N in NGG) did not significantly contribute to Cas9’s cleavage activity, but that the fourth 
nucleotide did significantly alter cleavage activity. We then employed model Eqs 6 and 15 to 
calculate the change in Gtarget, and therefore the change in GPAM, corresponding to each 
four nucleotide PAM sequence. As only the PAM sequences vary, the free energies Gexchange 
and Gsupercoiling were not expected to change significantly. To eliminate background noise, we 
excluded any PAM sequence that resulted in less than 1% cleavage. Further, we found that 
averaging cleavage activities over the first nucleotide position of each PAM sequence resulted 
in apparent free energies with a low coefficient of variation of 9%. Overall, we quantified the 
apparent GPAM free energies of 26 PAM sequences and found that they vary by 4 kcal/mol 
(Table 3), which is equivalent to about 700-fold change in instantaneous cleavage activity (all 
other factors being equal). 
As expected, the canonical PAM site NGGN binds with the highest affinity to Cas9 with 
GPAM energies exceeding -9 kcal/mol. However, there are several non-canonical PAM sites 
with sufficiently high affinities to contribute to off-target cleavage activity, including NAGN 
and NGWN. Further, the presence of a gap between a fully complementary protospacer and a 
PAM site does not fully ablate Cas9’s binding affinity; a single nucleotide gap (NNGG) penal- 
ized binding by 2.2 kcal/mol, while a single nucleotide bulge (GGNN) had a larger effect (a 3 
kcal/mol penalty). Recent studies have demonstrated that Cas9 can bind well to several non- 
canonical PAM site such as NAG, NGA, NAA, NTG, NGC, NCG, and NGT, though the extent 
of its promiscuity does depend on the Cas9 species origin [49,50]. Using the GPAM free ener- 
gies in Table 3 and an estimate of the DNA site’s superhelical density, the model can now

calculate the binding free energy ( Gtarget) of Cas9:crRNA when the crRNA’s guide sequence 
perfectly matches the DNA site’s sequence. To quantify the effects of mismatches, we next 
developed a free energy model ( Gexchange) that accounts for changes in the crRNA's guide 
sequence. 
Modeling the Effects of crRNA:DNA Site Mismatches 
A mismatch between the crRNA guide sequence and a DNA site destabilizes the formation of 
the Cas9:crRNA:DNA R-loop and increases the likelihood that the Cas9:crRNA complex disso- 
ciates prior to cleaving the DNA site [35,38,44]. In our model, we quantify the thermodynamics 
of the R-loop strand displacement process, comparing the free energy of the initial double- 
stranded DNA state to the free energy of the Cas9:crRNA:RNA R-loop, resulting in a free 
energy change ( Gexchange). Gexchange will change whenever a mismatch is introduced, 
though the magnitude of the change will depend on both the position of the mismatch and the 
surrounding sequence composition. As the last step in developing our model, we utilized three 
next-generation sequencing datasets (Table 1) to parameterize position- and sequence-depen- 
dent free energy models quantifying the Cas9:crRNA:DNA interactions during R-loop forma- 
tion. Three types of free energy models were created and compared to investigate whether Cas9 
plays a role in mediating these interactions, and whether these interactions varied across differ- 
ent host genomes. 
In the Pattanayak et al., the on-target and off-target cleavage activities from four sgRNAs 
were measured via deep sequencing across a degenerate library of DNA sites within an in vitro 
reaction [33]. In Hsu et. al. and Mali et. al., respectively, the amounts and locations of Cas9- 
based cleavage and dCas9-based transcriptional activation were recorded in vivo via deep 
sequencing [33,37,41]. We categorized these measurements into two data-sets, dataset I and II 
(Table 1). To analyze these data-sets, we first identified all DNA sites that utilized a canonical 
PAM sequence similar to the PAM sequence adjacent to the targeted sequences and yielded

greater than 50 read counts, finding 3671 sites in data-set I and 5979 sites in data-set II. Fur- 
ther, the superhelical densities of DNA sites are the same within the in vitro data-set, and 
largely similar across the E. coli genome, enabling us to disregard changes in Gsupercoiling for 
this analysis. We then compared sequencing read counts between Cas9 cleavage at the perfectly 
complementary (on-target) site and all off-target sites, obtaining a direct relationship between 
changes in sequencing read count and changes in Gexchange, according to our model Eqs 7 
and 8. When analyzing dCas9-based transcriptional activation measurements, we assumed 
that the dCas9 binding probability was proportional to the transcription rate of the target pro- 
moters. For each sequence, this rate was also proportional to the ratio of the background-sub- 
tracted read counts from the samples and the background-subtracted read counts from the 
positive controls. We then utilized Eqs 7 and 8 to convert the normalized RNA-Seq read counts 
into changes in Gexchange [51]. By excluding alternative PAM sites, we were able to more pre- 
cisely quantify the energetic effects of introducing mismatches into DNA site sequences. 
Comparing the Pattanayak et. al. and Hsu et. al. datasets, the overall average energetic pen- 
alty for a single mismatch was 0.14 and 0.78 kcal/mol, equivalent to a 1.26-fold and 3.7-fold 
drop in Cas9 activity, respectively, which suggests that the differences between in vivo and in 
vitro measurements and characterization protocol had an influence on off-target cleavage 
activities. However, some single mismatches were found to penalize Gexchange by 4 kcal/mol, 
equivalent to a 785-fold drop in Cas9 activity. Therefore, we next formulated position-depen- 
dent and sequence-dependent models to quantify how the introduction of mismatches in either 
the crRNA guide sequence or DNA site sequence affected Cas9 activity. 
In the first free energy model, we employed Eq 9 to calculate Gexchange, which quantifies 
the thermodynamic stability of the RNA-DNA and DNA-DNA complexes responsible for R- 
loop formation, together with 21 unknown position-dependent coefficients. While the free 
energies of DNA-DNA and DNA-RNA complementary duplexes have been measured [52] 
[53], there has been limited measurements of DNA-RNA mismatch free energies. Using a 
dinucleotide nearest-neighbor model, there are 240 types of RNA-DNA mismatches; however, 
the free energies of only about 72 of them have been experimentally measured [54,55,56,57,58]. 
After incorporating the known complementary and mismatch DNA-DNA and RNA-DNA 
free energies into Eq 9, and utilizing either dataset I or dataset II to parameterize the position- 
dependent coefficients, the resulting model was not able to predict Cas9 binding or cleavage 
activity (R2 = 0.32 and 0.07 for dataset I and dataset II, respectively; S4 Fig). Consequently, we 
anticipate that additional measurements of RNA-DNA mismatch free energies and kinetic 
modeling will improve the development of accurate first principles models of R-loop 
formation. 
We then developed an alternative free energy model (Eq 10) that does not rely on previous 
thermodynamic measurements of nucleic acid interactions, but instead uses measured Cas9 
activities at thousands of DNA sites to determine unknown model parameters. The free energy 
model accounts for all possible guide RNA guide sequences and DNA site sequences, employ- 
ing a dinucleotide nearest-neighbor model (256 unknown coefficients) together with 21 posi- 
tion-dependent coefficients. We determined the unknown parameters using either dataset I 
(3671 measurements) or dataset II (5979 measurements), utilizing nonlinear least-squares to 
minimize the error between the apparent and calculated Gexchange free energies (Materials 
and Methods). This parameterization determined values for 86% and 80% of the unknown 
parameters, using dataset I and II, respectively. In particular, these datasets lacked DNA sites 
with two consecutive mismatches, resulting in several unidentified parameters. The resulting 
free energy models for Gexchange were qualitatively consistent with anecdotal observations; 
for example, the first eight position-dependent coefficients have the highest values, accounting 
for about 67% (dataset II) to 81% (dataset I) of Gexchange variation, quantifying the impact of

PAM-proximal mismatches on Cas9 activity (Fig 4A). As a comparison, in a recent in vivo 
study [29], 87% of sequences with high binding affinities to a Cas9:crRNA complex have at 
most 1 mismatch within the first 8 nucleotides (Fig 4B). The apparent mismatch free energies 
also varied up to 5 kcal/mol, suggesting that mismatch sequence composition is an additional 
factor that affects Cas9 activity. However, the energetic penalties of specific mismatched RNA: 
DNA sequences were not necessarily the same across the two models. When parameterized 
with in vitro Cas9 cleavage measurements (dataset I), the most energetically unfavorable mis- 
matches were found at dAG, dGG, and dCG dinucleotides that were positioned over rAC, 
rAG/rGA, or rGT/rTG dinucleotides. In contrast, when parameterized with in vivo Cas9 activ- 
ity measurements (dataset II), the mismatch free energy penalties were more evenly distrib- 
uted, potentially due to confounding interactions arising from the DNA sites' chromatin states. 
Overall, the empirically parameterized free energy models were able to sufficiently account 
for the sequence- and position-dependent effects on Cas9 activity across the thousands of 
DNA sites (R2 = 0.74 and 0.61 for datasets I and II, respectively; Fig 4C). However, the maxi- 
mum uncertainty in a free energy parameter was 2 kcal/mol, indicating that there is significant 
opportunity for improving both the breadth and precision of Cas9 activity measurements with 
the objective of developing more accurate free energy models. 
Predicting dCas9 Binding Occupancy across the Lambda 
Bacteriophage Genome 
Next, we applied the parameterized mechanistic model to calculate dCas9 binding occupancies 
across the lambda bacteriophage genome when using a crRNA guide sequence that targets a 
specific genomic location, designated λ2. Our calculations mirror recently conducted experi- 
ments that monitored the dynamics of fluorescently labeled dCas9:crRNAλ2 as it interacted 
with an array of λ-phage genomic DNA within a flow chamber, called a DNA curtain [38]. 
Using these calculations, we examine how the sequence composition and PAM density of a 
genome affects the partitioning of dCas9 and its binding dynamics. 
Overall, the λ-phage genome contains 3179 and 2497 canonical PAM sites on its forward 
and reverse strands, respectively, together with 17933 and 16445 non-canonical PAM sites 
with a density of about one PAM site per 2.4 bp. To calculate the dCas9 binding free energies at 
all PAM sites, we identified their corresponding GPAM binding free energies (Table 3) and 
used both the λ2 guide and DNA site sequences to calculate the free energy change during R- 
loop formation ( Gexchange). Here, we utilized the previously parameterized distance-depen- 
dent coefficients (Fig 4) and a DNA:RNA mismatch penalty of 0.78 kcal/mol, which was the 
overall average energetic penalty observed in the Hsu et. al. data-set. We also assumed that all 
λ-phage genomic sites are equally supercoiled ( Gsupercoiling = 0). Model parameters are listed 
in S1 Table. 
We found that the binding free energies of dCas9:crRNAλ2 varied by 25 kcal/mol across the 
40054 PAM sites, and only 3880 of them had negative dCas9:crRNAλ2 binding free energies 
( Gtarget < 0) (Fig 5A). Most PAM-proximal DNA sites had large numbers of mismatches 
with the crRNAλ2 guide sequence, causing Gexchange to be more positive than GPAM (Fig 
5B and 5C). In particular, there were only 25 DNA sites that had highly negative binding free 
energies ( Gtarget < -6 kcal/mol). As expected, the λ2 DNA site formed a perfect DNA:RNA 
duplex with crRNAλ2, resulting in a zero model-calculated Gexchange penalty and a Gtarget 
of -9.9 kcal/mol. However, a second off-target DNA site, designated OS1, had a canonical PAM 
(GGGA, GPAM = -9.4 kcal/mol), only two mismatches within the 8 most PAM-proximal 
nucleotides, and an additional six mismatches in the remaining 12 nucleotides, yielding a 
Gtarget of -6.3 kcal/mol. Interestingly, fluorescently labeled dCas9 was observed to transiently

bind to OS1’s position in the λ-genome [38]. By enumerating and calculating the dCas9 bind- 
ing free energies for all PAM sites, we can then calculate the system’s overall partition function 
to determine their binding occupancies under several scenarios. 
The canonical partition function quantifies the amount of dCas9:crRNA that will be seques- 
tered under equilibrium conditions. It is also used in Eq 7 to determine the instantaneous binding 
probabilities to all DNA sites. When using dCas9:crRNAλ2, a fully accessible λ-genome has an 
overall partition function value of 162.6. The λ2 DNA site contributes the largest amount (151.04), 
indicating that it has the largest probability of being bound first. The off-target OS1 site contributes 
only 0.37 to the partition function summation, and therefore has a 408-fold lower probability of 
being bound first, compared to λ2. However, the additional 3879 off-target sites provide a signifi- 
cant contribution to the partition function summation, which will affect the binding occupancies 
at all PAM sites; sites with canonical PAMs contribute 7.83, while those with non-canonical PAMs 
contribute 3.36. As a result, it is 30-fold more likely that dCas9:crRNAλ2 will initially bind to one 
of these minor off-target sites, compared to the major off-target site OS1. Rather than searching 
only for PAMs with the most complementary DNA sites, it becomes important to enumerate all 
possible PAM sites to correctly determine their partition function contributions. 
We next applied the mechanistic model to determine how dCas9 binding occupancies to 
the λ-phage DNA curtains will change over time. Here, mirroring the experimental system, we 
assume constant dCas9 and crRNAλ2 concentrations of 10 nM and 100 nM, respectively, along 
with a system volume of 100 L. While our initial partition function calculations assumed that 
all λ-genome DNA sites are equally accessible, as dCas9:crRNA diffuses and binds to its DNA 
targets, it will irreversibly sequester DNA sites and eliminate their contributions to the parti- 
tion function. By substituting our partition function calculations into the model’s system of dif- 
ferential equations (Materials and Methods), using parameters listed in Table 2, we calculated 
how the numbers of accessible DNA sites change over time, which then alters the binding 
probabilities of the remaining DNA sites (Fig 5D and 5F). 
As expected, the λ2 DNA site binds fastest to dCas9:crRNAλ2 and is predicted to be fully 
bound within a minute (Fig 5E). During that time, the average binding occupancies of the 
other individual DNA sites do not appreciably increase. However, once the λ2 DNA site has 
been sequestered, the system’s overall partition function decreases from 162.6 to 11.56, which 
increases the off-target binding rate of dCas9:crRNAλ2 by 14-fold. As a result, the OS1 major 
off-target DNA site becomes fully bound within the next 6 minutes. Then, once the OS1 off- 
target site has been sequestered, the remaining off-target DNA sites become the only possible 
locations where dCas9:crRNAλ2 can bind. DNA sites with Gtarget energies of -4, -2, and 0 
kcal/mol will become fully bound after 6 hours, 7 days, and 200 days, respectively. These calcu- 
lations assume that DNA sites remain indefinitely sequestered after dCas9 irreversibly binds, 
which is correct for this scenario. However, in growing cells, unbound DNA sites are continu- 
ously replenished through DNA replication according to the cell’s growth rate. 
Predicting the Frequency and Locations of Off-Target Cleavage during 
Human Genome Editing 
For Cas9-based genome editing to become reliably used for therapeutic applications, the fac- 
tors that determine the frequency and location of its off-target cleavage activity must be better 
understood. Here, we applied the mechanistic model to calculate the distribution of all possible 
off-target cleavage sites during Cas9-based human genome editing and the necessary next-gen- 
eration sequencing coverage to detect the resulting indel mutations with high certainty. As a 
clinically relevant example, our calculations mirrored a recent study that applied Cas9-based

genome editing to excise integrated copies of the HIV provirus from infected human U1 cell 
lines by cleaving genomic DNA at flanking LTR sites [45]. 
Using the parameterized model, we first calculated the binding free energies between Cas9: 
crRNALTR-B, using a guide RNA that complements the LTR-B recognition sequence, and all 
off-target DNA sites within the reference human genome, finding that there are 3105 DNA 
sites with negative binding free energies ( Gtarget < 0) [59]. We repeated these calculations on 
a single copy of the HIV provirus, including the on-target LTR-B site. We solved the model’s 
system of differential equations describing time-dependent cleavage at both on- and off-targets 
sites to determine their cleavage efficiencies after a 1000 hour time period, using the kinetic 
parameters in Table 2, a genome length (N) of 6.4x109 bp (forward and reverse strands), a 
8-fold higher system volume, a cell doubling time of 20 hours, and 100 nM initial concentra- 
tions for both Cas9 and crRNALTR-B (S2 Table). 
The resulting cleavage efficiencies varied considerably across eight orders of magnitude; the 
on-target LTR-B site reached 100% cleavage, while the off-target sites had cleavage efficiencies 
ranging from 1 in 10,000,000 (10−5%) to 85% (Fig 6A). The majority of off-target sites have 
extremely low cleavage efficiencies (less than 1%), creating a mixture of cells with high genomic 
heterogeneity. Consequently, if we assume that cleavage events become indel mutations, then 
identifying their locations across an entire genome will require a highly sensitive indel-specific 
assay or next-generation sequencing with high coverage. For example, to detect 50% of all 
expected indel locations across a genome, an assay must be capable of positively identifying the 
presence of an indel at a single location even if its frequency is only 1 in 5 (20%) within the 
genome mixture (Fig 6B). The assay must be 20-fold more sensitive (1 in 100) to detect 90% of 
all indel locations. When using next-generation sequencing for detection under a best-case sce- 
nario, at least 13X coverage will be needed to identify 50% of all expected indels and at least 
200X coverage to identify 90% of all indels (Fig 6C). 
Using the model, we then determined how the DNA sites’ cleavage distributions were 
affected when lowering the Cas9 and sgRNA concentrations by 10-fold (Fig 6A, blue). The dis- 
tribution shifted leftward and the off-target DNA sites’ average cleavage efficiency decreased 
from 1% to 0.1%. While decreasing the frequency of indels is the prime objective, an even more 
sensitive assay will be needed to confirm their absence. According to model calculations, an 
60X sequencing coverage will be needed to detect 50% of the expected indels, and 1000X cover- 
age will be needed to identify 90% of indels (Fig 6C). Importantly, instead of relying on next- 
generation sequencing, the model’s calculations can be used to design and prioritize the use of 
indel-specific assays that detect the presence of mutations in specific off-target sites with the 
highest model-predicted cleavage efficiencies. 
Optimal Experimental Conditions for Controlling (d)Cas9 Activity 
The efficiency of Cas9-based cleavage and dCas9-based gene regulation depends on several fac- 
tors, some controllable and others uncontrollable and host-specific. By manipulating the con- 
trollable factors, while accounting for the host-specific ones, on-target and off-target (d)Cas9 
activity can be appropriately varied as desired. In particular, in the future, it may become neces- 
sary to tune the extent of dCas9-based transcriptional regulation to more precisely control 
gene expression levels. To aid in rational experimental design, we use the model to show how 
all the system parameters affect (d)Cas9 activity and to present general guidelines for achieving 
desired on-target and off-target activities. 
First, we applied the model to calculate the dynamics of Cas9-based cleavage in actively 
growing cells, comparing several scenarios. The baseline model parameters are listed in S3 
Table. Intuitively, DNA sites with additional mismatches have reduced cleavage efficiencies

both at early and later time-points (Fig 7A). Perhaps less intuitively, increasing the guide 
RNA’s concentration by 10-fold beyond the baseline of 207 nM does not significantly increase 
steady-state cleavage efficiencies, but instead accelerates the cleavage process so that the 
steady-state condition is reached earlier. Further, if the organism’s cellular division rate 
increases by 2-fold, for example if the growth conditions or media are altered, then both the 
rates of cleavage and the steady-state cleavage efficiencies will drop by up to 2-fold. An 
increased growth rate has two general effects: it more quickly replenishes bound DNA sites 
with newly replicated ones, and it lowers the concentrations of Cas9 and guide RNA by dilu- 
tion. Finally, and more substantially, carrying out genome mutagenesis in another organism 
with a 10-fold larger genome has a large slowing effect on Cas9 diffusion and overall cleavage 
activity, greatly reducing cleavage efficiencies at all DNA sites. 
We next performed a sensitivity analysis on the model to examine how varying a system 
parameter affected cleavage at a single DNA site in an actively growing and dividing cell. If the 
DNA is fully complementary to the guide RNA sequence, its model-calculated minimum possi- 
ble binding free energy will be Gtarget = -9.9 kcal/mol, which yields a steady-state cleavage effi- 
ciency of 98% (Fig 7B). Consistent with our earlier examples, as Cas9’s binding free energy 
increases (lower affinity) above -9 kcal/mol, there will be significant drop in cleavage efficiency. 
DNA sites with Gtarget > -4.9 kcal/mol will have <1% cleavage efficiencies. The concentration 
(or number) of guide RNA will also have a significant effect on cleavage efficiencies, but only 
when the guide RNA is a limiting substrate in the formation of the active Cas9:crRNA complex. 
As a result, when increasing the guide RNA concentration, cleavage efficiencies will rise until a 
critical threshold and thereafter there will be a plateau in cleavage efficiency (Fig 7B). 
We next examined how these same parameters affected dCas9-based transcriptional regula- 
tion, and found similar relationships. The binding free energy between a guide RNA and its 
DNA site ( Gtarget) controls both the dynamics and steady-state transcription rate of a dCas9- 
regulated promoter (Fig 7C). The binding free energy can be tuned by purposefully introducing 
mismatches into the guide RNA; within the linear regime, a 1.0 kcal/mol increase in Gtarget 
will lower the binding occupancy of dCas9:crRNA by about 5-fold, which will increase a pro- 
moter’s transcription rate if dCas9 is utilized as a repressor (Fig 7D). The guide RNA concen- 
tration may also be controlled by employing environmentally-sensitive or inducible promoters. 
dCas9:crRNA’s binding occupancy at a particular DNA site depends sigmoidally on the 
crRNA expression level. There is a small range of crRNA expression levels where the largest 
change in dCas9:crRNA and promoter repression will take place. The addition of auxiliary 
crRNA binding sites will shift this sigmoidal curve rightwards. Large changes in binding occu- 
pancy also occur when the organism’s growth rate is increased or when gene regulation takes 
place in another organism with a larger genome (Fig 7C and 7D). Below, we discuss the impli- 
cations of these parameter sensitivities when engineering dCas9-based genetic circuits. 
Discussion 
We have developed the first mechanistic, quantitative model of CRISPR/Cas9 that encom- 
passes the multi-step process responsible for Cas9-based genome editing and dCas9-based 
gene regulation. Our dynamical model holistically accounts for the kinetics of expression and 
formation of the active Cas9:crRNA complex, mass transfer by passive three-dimensional dif- 
fusion, genome-wide site selection according to the formation of R-loops at PAM-containing 
DNA sites, and the kinetics of irreversible site binding (Fig 1). We parameterized the model by 
combining both in vitro and in vivo measurements of (d)Cas9 activity (Table 1), arriving at a 
11 parameter model (Table 2 and S2 Fig) that could explain how the concentrations of crRNA 
and Cas9 (Figs 2 and S3), DNA site supercoiling (Fig 3), canonical and non-canonical PAM

sites (Table 3), and the thermodynamics of R-loop formation (Figs 4 and S4) all collectively 
control genome-wide (d)Cas9 activity. In particular, we provide newly obtained measurements 
showing that R-loop formation at adjacent crRNA binding sites has an anti-cooperative effect 
on dCas9-based gene regulation, which can be explained by positive supercoiling of the sur- 
rounding DNA and the destabilization of R-loop formation (Fig 3). 
As part of our model-building, we found that once Cas9 binds to a target DNA site and 
begins to form an R-loop, it is far more likely to spontaneously dissociate than successfully 
form the R-loop and cleave the DNA site. Based on in vitro cleavage assay measurements (Fig 
2), Cas9’s dissociation kinetic constant (kd) is 625-fold higher than its cleavage kinetic constant 
(kc), suggesting that hundreds of rounds of binding, melting, strand displacement, and abortive 
dissociation occur before cleavage takes place, which would be similar to the binding dynamics 
of RNA polymerase during transcriptional initiation (Table 2). Interestingly, coincident with 
this observation, a recent study utilized FRET to show that the rate of dCas9 binding is much 
faster and more indiscriminate than the rate of Cas9 cleavage, due to coupled changes (allo- 
stery) in Cas9 that only activates DNA cleavage under a restricted protein conformation [59]. 
There have also been recent measurements of Cas9 activity at off-target sites that use non- 
canonical PAMs, including NAG, NGA, NAA, NTG, NGC, NCG, and NGT [3,49,50], inde- 
pendent of our model-building process. Many of these alternative PAMs arise from a bulge or 
gap between a canonical PAM site and the guide RNA sequence [3,50]; through systematic 
comparisons, we determined the energetic penalties of these gaps and bulges on (d)Cas9’s 
binding affinity (Table 3). We also developed three different free energy models for R-loop for- 
mation, showing that the thermodynamics of R-loop formation cannot be predicted using 
existing measurements of RNA:DNA mismatch free energies (S5 Fig). Instead, we developed a 
277 parameter empirical nearest-neighbor model and parameterized it using over 5000 mea- 
surements of (d)Cas9 activity (Fig 4). According to our model, the PAM-proximal 8 nucleotide 
seed region is responsible for up to 81% of (d)Cas9’s binding affinity and a single mismatch in 
this region lowers Cas9’s binding affinity by 14-fold. However, it is clear that the differences 
between in vitro and in vivo measurements have a confounding effect on (d)Cas9 R-loop for- 
mation and activity (Fig 4). 
By carrying out genome-wide calculations on the lambdaphage and human genomes, mir- 
roring recent experimental studies, we illustrated several physical principles governing (d)Cas9 
activity that remain relevant regardless of model parameterization. First, Cas9 irreversibly 
binds to DNA sites in a hierarchical order, and its occupation of the highest affinity on-target 
sites causes its rate of binding to off-target sites to substantially increase (Fig 5). Therefore, 
both Cas9 concentration as well as incubation time are critical factors that control off-target 
activity as anecdotally observed in previous studies [60]. Second, off-target binding is highly 
heterogeneous across a genome; the binding occupancy at individual off-target DNA sites may 
be small, but the collective binding of Cas9 to all off-target sites is substantial. When Cas9- 
based genome editing is used as a therapeutic, the verification of off-target cleavage events will 
require very high sequencing coverage or rationally selected indel-specific detection assays (Fig 
6). Third, our model explains why Cas9 off-target activity greatly varies across organisms. In 
bacteria, (d)Cas9 activity has been observed to be highly specific to its on-target sites [5,8] 
whereas, in human cells, next-generation sequencing has revealed thousands of off-target DNA 
cleavage events [5,29,42,50]. By modeling diffusion and genome-wide site specificity, we 
showed that the large increase in genome size, and not the difference in cell growth rate, is 
responsible for the observed increase in off-target activity. Importantly, it was necessary to 
identify and include both canonical and non-canonical PAM sites in our ensemble calculations 
to fully account for the breadth of off-target activity. These insights have the potential to greatly 
improve the predictive power of existing in silico target prediction methods [61,62] as recent

observations have found that about 60% of off-target sites are not correctly predicted by exist- 
ing bioinformatics models [50]. 
There are several practical steps that one can take to improve on-target Cas9 activity, while 
limiting off-target activity. First, the active Cas9:crRNA complex concentration controls the 
overall extent of off-target activity; if it’s high for a short period of time (10 nM for only 2 min- 
utes and 100 nM for only 3 hours in bacterial and mammalian cells, respectively), then the rate 
of binding to off-target sites will not substantially rise as on-target sites have become occupied. 
During preparation of this article, two recent studies have implemented inducible Cas9 activity 
by expressing Cas9 using a doxycycline-inducible promoter [63] or by expressing a split ver- 
sion of Cas9 that uses rapamycin-inducible FRB domains to activate self-assembly [64]. Both 
approaches lowered the number of observed, off-target indel mutations. Second, during the 
design of guide RNA sequences, the search for off-target DNA sites must at least include both 
canonical and non-canonical PAMs (Table 3). A more thorough search would calculate Cas9’s 
binding affinity ( Gtarget) across all accessible DNA sites, which would explicitly account for 
non-canonical PAMs as well as sequence- and distance-dependent mismatches. Third, several 
crRNAs may be designed and co-expressed to cleave the same genomic locus or to regulate the 
same promoter and thereby increase (d)Cas9 activity. According to our model, the occupancy 
of multiple Cas9:crRNA complexes at both on-target and off-target sites will be additive and 
independent so long as Cas9 expression is increased proportionally with the expression of addi- 
tional crRNAs and when the on-target binding sites are separated by at least 200 bp to mini- 
mize the site-to-site effects of positive DNA supercoiling. 
Finally, our modeling and experimental results have several implications when using 
dCas9-based gene regulation to engineer synthetic genetic circuits. First, extremely low crRNA 
expression levels are sufficient to form enough active dCas9:crRNA complexes to efficiently 
repress transcription because bacteria have small genomes and a low number of off-target sites. 
Further increases in crRNA expression had only a 3.7-fold change in transcriptional regulation 
as we observed in our reporter protein measurements (Fig 3). In other words, there are not 
enough DNA sites in bacterial cells to “sponge up” excess amounts of dCas9:crRNA complex. 
To increase an “inverter” circuit’s dynamic range, we showed that adding auxiliary on-target 
DNA sites on a high copy R6K plasmid will sequester dCas9:crRNA and shift the sigmoidal 
relationship between crRNA expression level and output promoter transcription rate. Adding 
either 2 or 4 auxiliary binding sites per plasmid (about 300 or 600 sites total) increased the cir- 
cuit’s dynamic range by 27- or 11-fold. Second, mismatches can be purposefully introduced 
into on-target DNA sites to control binding occupancy, and therefore control transcriptional 
regulation. According to our model, a mismatch in the first 8 bp PAM-proximal region will 
(on average) increase Gtarget by 0.78 kcal/mol and lower the binding occupancy of the dCas9: 
crRNA by 3.7-fold. Incorporating more mismatches will increase Gtarget additively and 
decrease binding occupancy in a multiplicative manner. Third, when several crRNAs are 
expressed, they will competitively bind to dCas9 to form different dCas9:crRNA complexes, 
causing the increased expression of one crRNA to lower the concentration of another Cas9: 
crRNA complex. Such non-orthogonal relationships are generally undesired when engineering 
digital genetic circuits, and can be alleviated by expressing dCas9 in proportion to the total 
crRNA level. However, mutual dependence between dCas9:crRNA activities may be produc- 
tively used to engineer analog signal processing circuits. Fourth, the effects of DNA supercoil- 
ing will have an impact on genetic circuit function. For example, computations using several 
input signals can be performed by co-regulating the same output promoter using different 
dCas9:crRNA complexes at adjacent crRNA binding sites. Even though the crRNA binding 
sites are adequately spaced apart to prevent steric interactions, site-to-site DNA supercoiling 
will inhibit the binding of one dCas9:crRNA when another has already bound, for example, by

11-fold when there are 4 nearby auxiliary sites. This anti-cooperative mechanism should be 
taken into account when engineering such “fan-in” genetic circuits. 
Materials and Methods 
Modeling the Expression and Formation of the Cas9:crRNA Complex 
Mature crRNA guide strands can be expressed in two ways: transcription of a single chimeric 
synthetic guide RNA (sgRNA) that contains the 5' target recognition region, followed by a con- 
served Cas9-binding hairpin [43]; or transcription of a precrRNA array and a tracrRNA that 
form an RNA duplex that is subsequently processed by RNAse III into a mature crRNA [2,65]. 
As a key difference, the precrRNA can contain multiple target recognition sequences, each sepa- 
rated by a repetitive spacer sequence. The tracrRNA binds to these repetitive spacers and forms a 
double-stranded complex with precrRNA, becoming a target for RNAse III cleavage [2,65,66]. 
The resulting RNAse processing can generate multiple mature crRNAs from a single precrRNA. 
Cas9 may bind with the tracrRNA before landing on the precrRNA, and facilitate the tracrRNA: 
precrRNA hybridization [65]. After the mature crRNA is loaded into Cas9, an unidentified RNA 
exonuclease trims its 5' end, leaving a target recognition sequence of about 20 nucleotides 
[46,66]. When not bound to a crRNA, wild-type Cas9 remains in a structural conformation that 
inhibits its cleavage activity [67]. During the crRNA loading process, Cas9 undergoes a rotational 
shift that exposes a DNA binding channel, yielding an active Cas9:crRNA complex. 
In our model, we first introduce the production rates of mature crRNA guide strands (rcrRNA) 
and Cas9 proteins (rCas9) as zero order reactions. These production rates can be varied by altering 
the DNA copy numbers or transcription rates of the precrRNA, sgRNA, or Cas9 as well as the 
translation rate of Cas9's mRNA [5,49]. We then employ mass action kinetics to describe the irre- 
versible formation of an intermediate Cas9:crRNA complex, followed by an irreversible isomeri- 
zation reaction that produces an active Cas9:crRNA complex. The rate of intermediate complex 
formation is quantified using a second order kinetic constant kf and the isomerization reaction's 
rate is quantified using a first order kinetic constant kI. As first order reactions, the crRNA, Cas9, 
and intermediate Cas9:crRNA complex degrade or become diluted at a rate quantified by the 
kinetic constants δcrRNA, δCas9,andδCas9:crRNA. Finally, the rate of target binding for each active 
Cas9:crRNA complex is designated rbinding, and will be derived below. 
The resulting differential equations (Eqs 1–4) describe the dynamics of Cas9 and crRNA 
expression and active complex formation in terms of their molecular counts, assuming that the 
cell has a constant volume. For our first biophysical model of the CRISPR/Cas9 system, we have 
ignored the effects of stochastic gene expression as well as the effects of discrete cellular division. 
In addition, to account for the production of multiple crRNA guide strands with different 
sequences, we expanded the system of differential equations by an index i to describe their pro- 
duction, active complex formation, and rate of target binding. We assumed that all expressed 
crRNA guide strands bind equally well to Cas9, and form active complexes at the same rate, with 
the same kinetic parameters (kf and kI). However, through competitive binding, the fraction of 
Cas9 bound to each crRNA guide strand will depend on the crRNAs' differing expression levels. 
The rates of Cas9-dependent cleavage will also differ across different crRNA guide strand

Modeling Cas9's Random Walk to Determine Its Search Rate 
Once formed, active Cas9:crRNA complexes do not undergo facilitated diffusion or hopping, 
but instead engage in three-dimensional molecular diffusion to search for DNA sites [38]. The 
rate of diffusion is governed by the diffusivity of the Cas9:crRNA complex (D), and also several 
host-specific factors, including the volume of the compartment (V) and the characteristic 
length between sites of production and binding (λ). Here, we assume that the cellular compart- 
ment is well-mixed such that the rate of net molar flow is zero, though the time required for a 
Cas9 protein to find a target DNA site depends on the rate of molecular diffusion. Accordingly, 
the rate of molecular diffusion for active Cas9:crRNA complexes using the ith crRNA guide 
strand (rRW,i) will be proportional to its concentration [68]: 
rRW;i ¼ 6DlNCas9:crRNA;i 
V 
ð5Þ 
Eq (5) is the molar ow rate, or contact rate, between active Cas9:crRNA complexes and all 
possible DNA sites inside the cell. We then use the sequences of the crRNA guide strand and 
the DNA site to calculate the probability that, once contact has been made, the active Cas9: 
crRNA complex binds to the DNA site and forms a stable Cas9:crRNA:DNA complex, called 
an R-loop. The rate of binding of the ith Cas9:crRNA complex to the jth DNA site is simply the 
product of the contact rate and the binding probability (P[i,j]): 
rbinding;½i;j ¼ P½i;j rRW;i 
ð6Þ 
To calculate this binding probability, we assume that the pool of active Cas9:crRNA complexes 
have reached chemical equilibrium with the pool of both on-target and off-target DNA sites. 
This assumption is valid because the number of potential DNA sites is always much larger than 
the number of Cas9:crRNA complexes. In addition, when the Cas9:crRNA levels have reached 
steady-state conditions, the system will become ergodic. Accordingly, we derive a partition 
function in terms of the ith active Cas9:crRNA complex's binding free energy to the jth DNA 
site sequence ( Gtarget,[i,j]) as well as the number of accessible DNA sites with the jth sequence 
(Ntarget,j). Here, our reference state is a DNA sequence that binds non-speci cally to Cas9: 
crRNA with a zero binding free energy. As the total number of non-speci c DNA binding sites,

we use twice of the host's genome length N. The binding probability will follow a Boltzmann 
distribution, and we may use both the reference state and partition function as normalization

Together, Eqs 6 and 7 provide a systematic approach for comparing the rates of binding for dif- 
ferent crRNA sequences. Our next step was to develop a sequence-dependent free energy 
model to calculate and predict these binding rates for any crRNA guide strand sequence. 
A Free Energy Model for DNA Target Binding, R-Loop Formation, and 
Cleavage 
The binding free energy of an active Cas9:crRNA complex to a particular DNA site controls its 
binding occupancy, and ultimately, its cleavage rate. Several interactions control the magnitude 
of this binding free energy, including the presence of a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) site, 
the rate of R-loop formation during a multi-step exchange reaction, and the effects of super- 
coiling at the DNA site. Here, we employed thermodynamics to quantify the energetics of these 
interactions and developed a multi-term free energy model that calculates Gtarget [i,j] for differ- 
ent crRNA guide strand sequences, DNA site sequences, canonical and non-canonical PAM 
sequences, and varying amounts of DNA site supercoiling. Altogether, the free energy model 
sums together the strengths of these interactions, according to: 
DGtarget½i;j ¼ DGPAM;j þ DDGexchange½i;j þ DDGsupercoiling;j 
ð8Þ 
Next, we describe the mechanism of R-loop formation and how these interactions' free energies 
are quanti ed. 
After contacting a DNA site, a Cas9:crRNA complex recognizes and binds to the PAM 
sequence [35,69]. The canonical PAM site for the Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes is NGG, 
though additional non-canonical sequences have also been recognized [3,4,8,37]. The Cas9: 
crRNA complex then pulls apart the double-stranded DNA upstream of the PAM sequence, 
which is an energetically intensive process. Cas9 does not hydrolyze an energy-providing cofac- 
tor, such as ATP or GTP. Instead, its only significant source of external energy input originates 
from the binding interactions between the Cas9 protein and the PAM recognition sequence 
[38], which we designate as GPAM. As we show below, the most canonical PAM recognition 
sequence has an apparent GPAM of about -9.5 kcal/mol, which is sufficient to pull apart four 
G:C or eight A:T DNA base pairings. Non-canonical PAM sequences have less energetically 
favorable interactions with Cas9, but can still support R-loop formation and cleavage 
[3,37,44,49]. 
The Cas9:crRNA complex continues to pull apart double-stranded DNA by performing an 
exchange reaction, allowing the crRNA guide strand to form RNA:DNA base pairings with its 
complementary DNA strand [38,44,70]. In step-wise transitions, each DNA base pair is pulled 
apart, and the corresponding nucleotide from the crRNA binds to form a Watson-Crick base 
pair, resulting in the formation of a DNA:Cas9:crRNA:DNA sandwich, called an R-loop. R- 
loop formation is directional and sequential, beginning at the PAM site, and proceeding 
upstream. Before the R-loop is completed, strand displacement can stall and reverse, resulting 
in Cas9:crRNA dissociation, whenever the DNA:DNA complex becomes more stable than the

DNA:Cas9:crRNA:DNA complex. We designated this difference in stability as Gexchange;if 
Gexchange becomes positive and large, the R-loop can not successfully form. To investigate 
whether Cas9 plays a role in target specificity, we then developed and parameterized two ver- 
sions of a free energy model to calculate Gexchange for a given crRNA and DNA site sequence, 
where the first model incorporates only nucleic acid interactions, while the second model 
accounts for both nucleic acid and Cas9-dependent interactions. 
In the first model version, when the crRNA and DNA site are fully complementary, 
Gexchange is governed by the difference in free energy between the RNA:DNA duplex 
and its corresponding DNA:DNA duplex. Interestingly, this difference is free energy is sequen- 
ce-dependent; for example, the binding free energy of the dinucleotide base pair rAC:dGT is 
1.0 kcal/mol more stable than dAC:dGT, while the binding free energy of rCG:dCG is 1.6 kcal/ 
mol less stable than dCG:dCG [53]. These nearest-neighbor free energies are designated as 
GRNA:DNA and GDNA:DNA, and may be calculated using previously developed free energy 
models that have been parameterized using calorimetry measurements [52,53,54,55]. Second, 
because of the sequential nature of R-loop formation, when the crRNA has non-complemen- 
tary bases with the DNA site, the effect of the resulting mismatches will depend on their dis- 
tance from the PAM site. For simplicitly, we introduce a position-dependent multiplicative 
weight dk that modulates the impact of these free energy differences. k is location and varies 
from 0 to the crRNA guide strand's length; the value of d1 will be larger than d20. 
Therefore, our first approach for calculating Gexchange compares the thermodynamic sta- 
bility of the ith crRNA:DNA complex to the stability of the jth DNA:DNA duplex, using the fol- 
lowing expression: 
DDGexchange½i;j ¼ Xk dk½DGRNA:DNA 
k;kþ1 DGDNA:DNA 
k;kþ1 
ð 
9Þ 
where the summations proceed over the lengths of the crRNA:DNA and DNA:DNA sequences. 
Eq (9) has 21 unknown dk parameter values and uses dinucleotide free energies that were previ- 
ously parameterized in the absence of Cas9 [52,53,54,55]. 
However, it is possible that the Cas9 protein alters the stability of the R-loop in a sequence- 
specific fashion. To investigate this possibility, our second approach to calculating Gexchange 
is to formulate an entirely empirical nearest-neighbor model, which enumerates all possible 
dinucleotide RNA:DNA duplexes and mismatches together with the distance-dependent coef- 
ficients, resulting in 277 unknown parameters. In the result section below, we determined these 
parameter values using thousands of experimental measurements of off-target and on-target 
Cas9 activity. Once parameterized, the following expression is used to calculate Gexchange for 
any crRNA and DNA site sequence: 
DDGexchange½i;j ¼ Xk dkDDGCas9:crRNA:DNA

ð10Þ 
where the summation proceeds over the length of the crRNA:DNA sequence. In the results sec- 
tion, we systematically compared the accuracy of these two models to quantitatively determine 
Cas9's effect on DNA site speci city. 
Next, we incorporated the effects of DNA site supercoiling into the model of Cas9:crRNA's 
binding energetics. Negative supercoiling, the untwisting of helical DNA, increases the stability 
of an R-loop by lowering the stability of the competing DNA:DNA complex [44]; however, 
there is a free energy input to form supercoiled DNA. When relaxed B-form helical DNA of 
length n is (un)twisted by 10σ turns, the change in free energy will be Gsupercoiling =10nσ2kbT, 
where σ is the superhelical density, kb is the Boltzmann constant, and T is temperature [71]. 
Due to the activity of topoisomerases and gyrases inside cells, the superhelical density of

bacterial and human genomic DNA varies between σ = -0.02 and -0.1, depending on the loca- 
tion's distance from the origin of replication and its proximity to highly transcribed genes 
[72,73]. If a DNA site has already been negatively supercoiled by the host’s native enzymes, 
then a free energy input is not needed to stabilize the R-loop. However, if the DNA site is 
relaxed or positively supercoiled, then the additional free energy needed to untwist it will 
increase the dissociation rate of the Cas9:crRNA complex as it forms the R-loop. Accordingly, 
the dissociation kinetic constant of the Cas9:crRNA complex will depend on the degree of 
DNA site supercoiling according to 
kd;j ¼ kd expð DGsupercoiling;j=kbTÞð 
11Þ 
where we determine the free energy input needed to untwist the DNA site by comparing the 
superhelical density of an R-loop in its nal state (σF) with the initial superhelical density of the 
DNA site using (σI) the expression. 
DGsupercoiling;j ¼ 10nkbTðs2F s2I Þð 
12Þ 
The change in supercoiling energy in Eq 7 is a result of binding to a target from a non-speci c 
site. Therefore, the energy term must be calculated based on the change in superhelical density 
of these targets (Eq 13). An average superhelical density of -0.06 for all nonspeci c binding 
sites (σNS) has been previously reported for E. coli genome [74,75]. 
DDGsupercoiling;j ¼ 10nkbTðs2I s2NSÞð 
13Þ 
After the R-loop has formed, the DNA:Cas9:crRNA:DNA complex has the ability to cut the 
DNA strands, one at a time, typically at the third nucleotide upstream of the PAM site [4]. As 
measured by a time-course cleavage assay, an appreciable amount of nicked DNA accumulates 
before double-stranded DNA breaks are observed, indicating that Cas9’s endonuclease reaction 
is a slow, rate-limiting step. Unlike most enzymes, after Cas9 has doubly cut its DNA site, the 
Cas9:crRNA complex remains stably bound to the DNA site and does not have the ability to 
cleave DNA at another site [38]. This absence of turnover causes Cas9 to become a limiting 
reactant. However, before Cas9 has doubly cut its DNA site, optical trap pulling experiments 
have shown that the formation of the R-loop is reversible and that the DNA:Cas9:crRNA:DNA 
complex can dissociate [44]. In light of these two competing pathways, we derived an expres- 
sion for the cleavage rate of the ith Cas9:crRNA complex bound to the jth DNA site: 
rC½i;j ¼ kc 
kc þ kd;j rbinding½i;j 
ð14Þ 
where the rate of cleavage is controlled by a rst-order kinetic constant kC and the effects of 
DNA supercoiling on the dissociation kinetic constant, kd, are determined using Eq 11. 
Modeling the Genome-Wide Occupancies at On-Target and Off-Target 
DNA Sites 
Finally, we calculate the total numbers of free, bound, and cut DNA sites over time by account- 
ing for the production of DNA sites via DNA replication and their consumption by Cas9-based 
cleavage. Initially, the host organism begins with Ntotal,j copies of an accessible DNA site 
(type j). For chromosomally encoded DNA sites, Ntotal,j will vary between 0 and 2, depending 
on their distance from the chromosome's origin of replication and whether the site is located 
within accessible euchromatin or inaccessible heterochromatin. For plasmid-encoded DNA 
sites, Ntotal,j is the plasmid’s DNA copy number. After Cas9 binds and cleaves a DNA site, we

/*** End Page =24= ***/
/*** Page =25= ***/
assume that Cas9 remains bound to the site. After cleavage, the rate of DNA repair via homolo- 
gous recombination or non-homologous end-joining will depend on several factors, for exam- 
ple, the host organism and the concentration of the repair DNA template. Here, we assume 
that the rate of DNA repair is proportional to the number of cut DNA sites. We also assume 
that, in actively growing cells, the replication rate of DNA sites is the cell’s division rate, desig- 
nated as . Once a newly available DNA site has been replicated, it is distributed to daughter 
cells during division. Therefore, the net production rate of available DNA sites is the cell’s 
growth rate multiplied by the number of cleaved DNA sites, which is equivalent to (Ntotal,j— 
Ntarget,j),where Ntarget,j is the number of unbound DNA sites. Together, the rate of DNA repli- 
cation and Cas9-dependent cleavage determines the total number of cut and uncut DNA sites 
within the organism, according to: 
dNtarget;j 
dt ¼ mðNtotal;j Ntarget;jÞ Xi 
rC½i;j 
ð15Þ 
Altogether, for a genetic system that expresses η crRNAs in a host with z available DNA 
sites, the formally complete biophysical model of CRISPR/Cas9 consists of 3η + z (η+1) + 1 
ordinary differential equations, which can be a large number. With further time-scale analysis 
that distinguishes between on-target and off-target DNA sites, there are several options for 
greatly reducing the number of partition function calculations and differential equations to 
determine the fraction of DNA sites that are free, bound, or cut. In one example, in early time 
periods, the low cleavage rates for the off-target DNA sites causes their differential equations to 
be well-approximated as linear, as compared to the highly coupled and non-linear differential 
equations for the on-target DNA sites. The analytical solutions to the differential equations for 
the off-target sites can then substituted into the numerical integration of the on-target DNA 
sites’ differential equations. In another example, determining the steady-state numbers of on- 
target and off-target DNA sites requires the solution of a system of multivariate quadratic poly- 
nomials, which can be efficiently computed using an iterative hybrid Krylov method [76]. 
With the availability of such analytical and numerical approximations, it is possible to solve the 
complete model using a mammalian genome without computational intractability, though an 
analysis to find the best approximation remains a topic for a future study. 
The Effects of Supercoiling on Adjacent DNA Sites 
When a Cas9:crRNA complex binds to a DNA site, the formation of the R-loop will result in 
positive supercoiling of the surrounding DNA sites, due to conservation of the DNA linking 
number in the absence of topoisomerase or gyrase activity [77]. Positive supercoiling of DNA 
will alter the affinities of DNA-binding proteins, such as RNA polymerase [78] or other Cas9: 
crRNA complexes. These longer-range effects become important when crRNAs are designed to 
bind to several nearby on-target DNA sites, for example, when targeting two different DNA 
sites with a chimeric dCas9-FokI fusion [39], when inserting recombinant DNA between two 
nicked or doubly cleaved DNA sites, or when using dCas9 to regulate the transcription rate of a 
promoter using multi-input logic. Whenever multiple on-target DNA sites are adjacently 
located, we therefore modified the free energy model for Gtarget to incorporate the site-to-site 
effects of supercoiling. 
Consider multiple DNA sites located within a short segment of DNA surrounded by a type 
of fixed end, for example, between two active promoters, DNA replication origins, or other 
sites where DNA-binding proteins constrain DNA topology. When Cas9:crRNA binds to one 
of these DNA sites, the unwinding of the DNA site during R-loop formation increases the 
superhelical density of the remaining DNA segment by an amount σ (more positive), which

/*** End Page =25= ***/
/*** Page =26= ***/
depends on the lengths of the DNA site and the DNA segment. With the increase in supercoil- 
ing from σj to σj + σ (from negative to less negative), Cas9:crRNA will require an additional 
free energy input to bind to the remaining DNA sites within the segment and form an R-loop, 
according to Eq (12). As more DNA sites are bound by Cas9:crRNA, we assume that the link- 
ing number is conserved, yielding an increase in superhelical density from σj to σj + c σ for c 
bound DNA sites. Eventually, the free energy needed to stabilize the R-loop will become suffi- 
ciently large to prevent Cas9:crRNA from binding additional DNA sites within this DNA seg- 
ment. According to our calculations below, σ is about 0.0065. To calculate these binding 
probabilities, we modified the partition function in Eq (7), accounting for the combinations of 
states where Cas9:crRNA has bound c adjacent DNA sites with their corresponding supercoil- 
ing-dependent energy penalties. 
Additional Model Considerations and Assumptions 
There are additional factors, not included within this model, that can affect Cas9's ability to 
recognize and bind crRNAs as well as cleave DNA sites. Outside of the crRNA guide sequence, 
the tracrRNA and sgRNA form four stem loop structures that are responsible for recognizing 
and binding to Cas9 [43]. While the third and fourth stem loops are not essential for recogni- 
tion, truncation of these structures did reduce the stability of the Cas9:crRNA complex. In 
another study, it was observed that truncated sgRNAs resulted in lower cleavage rates at both 
on-target and off-target DNA sites, which suggests that there were either fewer active Cas9: 
crRNA complexes or that active complexes had lower intrinsic cleavage activities [33]. Here, 
the biophysical model assumes that the tracrRNA and sgRNA fold into the wild-type structure. 
Further, while Cas9 can bind well to both single- and double-stranded DNA, its cleavage rate is 
significantly reduced when bound to single-stranded DNA or a truncated double-stranded 
DNA site [38]. The current biophysical model only considers double-stranded DNA sites 
within long contiguous DNA, such as plasmids and genomes. 
Overall, the developed mechanistic model can estimate the probability of binding and 
cleavage for any Cas9 target DNA. In addition to degradation rate of all the involved molecules 
(δi), the final model’s parameters are kf,kI (complex formation step), GPAM, Gexchange, 
Gsupercoiling,kd, c (stabilizing target binding), and kc (cleavage step). The input parameters are 
the exposure time (t) and the production rate of Cas9 (rCas9) and crRNA (rcrRNA). For a system 
containing 1 type of crRNA and N on- and off-targets, the concentrations of free Cas9, crRNA, 
intermediate complex, free active Cas9:crRNA complex and the targets are unknown, and can 
be calculated by solving N+4 ordinary differential equations (Eqs 1–4, 14 and 15) simulta- 
neously. In the following sections, we have used multiple in vivo and in vitro measurements to 
estimate the model parameters in different conditions. A summary of the studies and the uti- 
lized data is provided in Table 1. 
Model Simulation and Parameterization Approach 
Differential equations were numerically integrated using a variable-order, adaptive time-step- 
ping stiff numerical solver (ode15s) in MATLAB. For comparison to experimental measure- 
ments, the relative errors between model solution and experimental measurements were 
calculated over the measurements' time interval or after a steady-state condition was reached. 
In Table 1, we summarize the several types of experimental measurements used to parameter- 
ize and validate the model, including the number of degrees of freedom and the number of 
data-points in each experimental data-set. To identify a narrow range of best-fit parameter val- 
ues, model parameterization was performed by using either a simple simplex method (fmin- 
search) or a Levenberg-Marquardt method (lsqnonlin) in MATLAB to minimize the sum of

squared relative errors, followed by a parameter sensitivity analysis and visual comparisons to 
more precisely identify best-fit model parameters. 
Strains and Plasmids 
To validate model predictions, we constructed three plasmids that employ dCas9 to transcrip- 
tionally regulate expression of a reporter protein. The first plasmid expresses the YFP fluores- 
cent protein reporter on a R6K vector using a KanR antibiotic marker. The YFP expression 
cassette contains a σ70 promoter (J23100), a synthetic ribosome binding site designed by the 
RBS Calculator [79,80,81], a codon-optimized YFP coding sequence, and an efficient transcrip- 
tional terminator [82]. A primary crRNA binding site is located within the promoter region 
with the sequence (5'—TATCGTTAAGGTTACTAGAG—3'). Where noted, between one to 
eight auxiliary crRNA binding sites with the same sequence as the primary crRNA binding site, 
each separated by 80 nucleotides of randomized DNA, were inserted downstream of the tran- 
scriptional terminator. To insert auxiliary binding sites, gBLOCK DNA fragments (Integrated 
DNA Technologies) were synthesized and assembled with a digested vector fragment using T4 
ligation. The second plasmid constitutively expresses Cas9 and tracrRNA on a p15A vector 
using an AmpR antibiotic marker. Plasmid construction was performed by PCR-amplifying 
the Cas9 and tracrRNA expression cassettes from the pdCas9 plasmid [8] and assembling with 
a PCR-amplified p15A vector fragment using Gibson's method [83]. The third plasmid 
expresses the precrRNA using an IPTG-inducible Ptac promoter on a ColE1 vector using a 
CmR antibiotic marker, and was constructed by PCR-amplifying the precrRNA cassette from 
pdCas9 and assembling it with a PCR-amplified ColE1 fragment using Gibson's method. The 
precrRNA contains two BsaI sites flanking the protospacer region, which were utilized to insert 
new crRNA guide sequences into the precrRNA with digestion and ligation of annealed oligo- 
nucleotides. Cloned plasmids were verified by sequencing. The three plasmids were electropo- 
rated together into E. coli pir116, and selected on triple antibiotic agar plates. 
Growth and Measurements 
Transformed strains were grown overnight at 37°C and 200 RPM in LB Miller supplemented 
with 10 g/ml chloramphenicol, kanamycin, and ampicillin (Sigma-Aldrich). 5 l of cultures 
were diluted into fresh selective media in a 96-well microplate, incubated, and shaken at 37°C 
in a TECAN M1000 spectrophotometer. Serial dilutions were performed twice to maintain 
cells in the exponential phase of growth for a 12 hour period. 10 l samples were extracted after 
the second and third serial dilutions and added to 200 l Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) sup- 
plemented with 2 mg/mL kanamycin for halting growth. Single-cell YFP fluorescence from at 
least 20,000 cells were recorded by an BD Fortessa flow cytometer. The average YFP expression 
level was determined by taking the average of the fluorescence distribution and subtracting the 
average auto-fluorescence of E. coli pir116.
