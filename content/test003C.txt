Preface This book grew out of a graduate course on 3-manifolds taught at Emory University in the spring of 2003. It aims to introduce the beginning graduate student to central topics in the study of 3-manifolds. Prerequisites are kept to a minimum but do include some point set topology (see [109]) and some knowledge of general position (see [128]). In a few places, it is worth our while to mention results or proofs involving concepts from algebraic topology or differential geometry. This should not stop the interested reader with no background in algebraic topology or differential geometry from enjoying the material presented here. The sections and exercises involving algebraic topology are marked with a *, those involving differential geometry with a **. This book conveys my personal path through the subject of 3-manifolds during a certain period of time (roughly 1990 to 2007). Marty Scharlemann deserves credit for setting me on this path. He remains a much appreciated guide. Other guides include Misha Kapovich, Andrew Casson, Rob Kirby, and my collaborators. In Chapter 1 we introduce the notion of a manifold of arbitrary dimen- sion and discuss several structures on manifolds. These structures mayor may not exist on a given manifold. In addition, if a particular structure exists on a given manifold, it mayor may not be presented as part of the information given. In Chapter 2 we consider manifolds of a particular di- mension, namely 2-manifolds, also known as surfaces. Here we provide an overview of the classification of surfaces and discuss the mapping class group. Chapter 3 gives examples of 3-manifolds and standard techniques used to study 3-manifolds. In Chapter 4 we catch a glimpse of the interaction of pairs of manifolds, specifically pairs of the form (3- manifold, I-manifold). Of - . IX

x Preface particular interest here is the considertion of knots from the point of view of the complement ("Not Knot"). For other perspectives, we refer the reader to the many books, both new and old, mentioned in Chapter 4, that provide a more in-depth study. In Chapter 5 we consider triangulated 3-manifolds, normal surfaces, almost normal surfaces, and how these set the stage for algorithms pertaining to 3-manifolds. In Chapter 6 we cover a subject near and dear to the author's heart: Heegaard splittings. Heegaard splittings are decompositions of 3-manifolds into symmetric pieces. They can be thought of in many different ways. We discuss key examples, classical problems, and recent advances in the subject of Heegaard splittings. In Chapter 7 we introduce hyperbolic structures on manifolds and complexes and provide a glimpse of how they affect our understanding of 3-manifolds. We include two appendices: one on general position and one on Morse functions. Exercises appear at the end of most sections. I wish to thank the many colleagues and students who have given me the opportunity to learn and teach. I also wish to thank the institutions that have supported me through the years: University of California, Emory University, Max-Planck-Institut fur Mathematik Bonn, Max-Planck-Institut fur Mathematik Leipzig, and the National Science Foundation.

Chapter 1 Perspectives on Manifolds Manifolds are studied in a variety of categories. We will introduce sev- eral of these categories and highlight the advantages of the different points of view. We will focus on topological manifolds (TOP), differentiable (or smooth) manifolds (DIFF) and triangulated (or combinatorial) manifolds (TRIANG). To see these definitions in context, consult introductory Chap- ters in [93], [100], [48], [148], [63], [67], [59], or [37]. 1.1. Topological Manifolds Definition 1.1.1. A topological n-manifold is a second countable Hausdorff space M for which there exists a family of pairs {(Mo:, <Po:)} with the follow- ing properties: . Va, Mo: is an open subset of M and M = Uo: Mo:; . Va, <Po: is a homeomorphism from Mo: to an open subset of JRn. We often refer to a topological manifold simply as a manifold. A pair (Mo:, <Po:) is called a chart of M. The family of pairs {(Mo:, <Po:)} is called an atlas for M. (We sometimes write only {Mo:} rather than {(Mo:,<po:)} when the maps <Po: are not part of the discussion.) The dimension of an n-manifold is n. Two n-manifolds are considered equivalent if they are homeomorphic. Remark 1.1.2. Every subset of JRN is second countable and Hausdorff. Thus to show that a subset M of JRN is an n-manifold it suffices to show that every point in M has a neighborhood homeomorphic to JRn. - 1 
/*** End Page =12= ***/
/*** Page =13= ***/
2 1. Perspectives on Manifolds Requiring these homeomorphisms to map onto JRn is equivalent to requir- ing them to map onto open subsets of JRn. In exhibiting homeomorphisms we often opt for the latter, in the interest of simplicity. Example 1.1.3. One immediate example of an n-manifold is JRn and open subsets of JRn. Example 1.1.4. The set sn = {x E JRn+l : IIxll = I} is an n-dimensional manifold called the n-sphere. Stereographic projection provides a homeo- morphism h : sn\ {(O, . . . , 0, I)}  JRn. Thus any point x E sn such that x =I (0,...,0,1) has the neighborhood sn\{(o,...,O,I)} that is homeo- morphic to JRn. To exhibit a neighborhood of (0,...,0,1) that is home- omorphic to JRn we compose the reflection in JRn x {O} with h to obtain h': sn\{(o,...,O,-I)}  JRn. Thus sn\{(o,...,O,-I)} is a neighborhood of (0,...,0,1) homeomorphic to JRn. See Figure 1.1. Figure 1.1. The 2-dimensional sphere. Example 1.1.5. The set Tn = Sl x... X Sl (n factors) is called the n- torus. The n-torus is a quotient space obtained as follows: In JRn, consider the group G generated by translations of distance 1 along the coordinate axes. Then identify two points x, y E JRn if and only if there is agE G such that g(x) = y. Denote this quotient map by q : JRn  Tn. To see that Tn is an n-manifold, let [x] E Tn and let U be the sphere of radius i centered at x E JRn. Note that g(U) n U = 0 \/g E G. It follows that q-1Iq(u) : q(U)  U is a homeomorphism. The set of all such homeomorphisms provides an atlas for JRn. See Figures 1.2 and 1.3. Example 1.1.6. The result of identifying antipodal points on sn is an n- manifold. It is called n-dimensional real projective space and is denoted by JRpn. To verify that JRpn is an n- manifold, consider a point [x] in JRpn. Since

The 2-dimensional torus. sn is an n-manifold, there is a neighborhood U of x and a homeomorphism h : U  JRn. Set -U = a(U), for a : sn  sn the antipodal map. Then -U is a neighborhood of -x and -h = h 0 a is a homeomorphism between -U and JRn. After shrinking U, if necessary, a(U) n U = 0. Thus we have a homeomorphism [h] : [U]  JRn. The set of all such homeomorphisms defines an atlas for JRpn. See Figure 1.4. a a Figure 1.4. The projective plane obtained from a bigon via identifications. Definition 1.1.7. Let M be an n-manifold. A p-dimensional submanifold of M is a closed subset L of M for which there exists an atlas {(Ma, cPa)}

4 1. Perspectives on Manifolds of M such that Vx E L there is a chart in the atlas with x E Mo. and <po.(L n Mo.) = {O} x JRP C JRn. Remark 1.1.8. A submanifold is itself a manifold. Example 1.1.9. The equatorial circle in the 2-sphere indicated in Figure 1.1 is a submanifold of the 2-sphere. Definition 1.1.10. Let L, M be manifolds. A map f : L  M is an embedding if it is a homeomorphism onto its image f (L) and f (L) is a submanifold of M. Example 1.1.11. If L is a submanifold of M, then the inclusion map i : L  M of an abstract copy L of L to L c M is an embedding. We will also consider a slightly larger class of objects: Definition 1.1.12. Set H n = {(Xl,..., X n ) E JRn : Xl > O}. An n-manifold with boundary is a second countable Hausdorff space M with an atlas such that Va, <Po. is a homeomorphism from Mo. to an open subset of JRn or H n . The boundary of M is the set of all points in M that have a neighbor- hood homeomorphic to Hn but no neighborhood homeomorphic to JRn. The boundary of M is denoted by 8M. Points not on the boundary are called interior points. Two n-manifolds with boundary are considered equivalent if they are homeomorphic. Example 1.1.13. The set Jmn = {x E JRn : IIxll < I} is an n-dimensional manifold with boundary called the n-ball. For interior points, there is noth- ing to check (because the identity map on JRn provides the required home- omorphism). For boundary points, an extension of the map obtained by stereographic projection provides the required homeomorphism. See Fig- ure 1.5. Figure 1.5. The 2-ball is also called the disk.

1.1. Topological Manifolds 5 Example 1.1.14. The pair of pants is a 2-manifold with boundary. See Figure 1.6. Figure 1.6. The pair of pants. Example 1.1.15. The I-holed torus is a 2-manifold with boundary. See Figure 1.7. "(--y Figure 1.7. The I-holed torus. Definition 1.1.16. Let M be an n-manifold with boundary. A p-dimen- sional submanifold of M is a closed subset L of M for which there is an atlas {(Mo:, <Po:)} of M and p E {O,. . . , n} such that \Ix E L in the interior of M there is a chart in the atlas such that x E Mo: and <po:(L n Mo:) = {O} x JRP C JRn and \Ix E L in the boundary of M there is a chart in the atlas such that x E Mo: and <po:(L n Mo:) = {O} x HP C H n and such that <Po:(x) E {O} x 8HP c 8H n . Remark 1.1.17. The boundary, 8M, of an n-manifold M is not a subman- if old of M, though it is an (n - 1 )-dimensional manifold that is contained in M. Example 1.1.18. The diameter of the disk pictured in Figure 1.8 is a submanifold of a manifold with boundary.

6 1. Perspectives on Manifolds Figure 1.8. A submanifold of the disk. Definition 1.1.19. We say that the n-manifold M is closed if M is compact and 8M = 0. Example 1.1.20. Spheres and tori are examples of closed manifolds. In the TOP category, that is, when we study manifolds from the point of view in this section, we are interested in continuous maps between manifolds. Example 1.1.21. Projection from 'Jr2 = Sl X Sl onto the second factor is a continuous map between manifolds. To catch a glimpse of intriguing topological manifolds browse [78]. Exercises Exercise 1. Convince yourself that the statements in Remark 1.1.2 are true. Exercise 2. Prove that the product of two manifolds is a manifold. What can you say about its dimension? (This provides an alternate proof of the fact that 'Jrn is a manifold.) Exercise 3. Show that the boundary of an n-manifold with boundary is an (n -I)-manifold without boundary. See for instance the I-holed torus in Figure 1.7. Exercise 4. By drawing pictures, convince yourself that the surface with boundary called the pair of pants is aptly named. Exercise 5. Argue that the I-manifolds pictured in Figure 1.9 are equiva- lent. (You needn't give a formal proof.)

1.2. Differentiable Manifolds 7 Figure 1.9. Homeomorphic I-manifolds. 1.2. Differentiable Manifolds Recall the following notion from calculus: Definition 1.2.1. A map f : JRn  JRm is said to be cq if it has continuous partial derivatives of order q. A map is said to be smooth (or COO) if it has partial derivatives of all orders. Definition 1.2.2. A cq -manifold, for q E [0, 00], is a topological mani- fold M with an atlas that satisfies the additional requirement of being C q , meaning that for any pair of charts (Mo:, <Po:), (M{3, <P{3) in this atlas, the map <P{3 0 <P o: 1 (where it is defined) is C q . A Coo-manifold is also called a differentiable, or smooth, manifold. Given an atlas for a manifold, a map of the form <P{3 0 <P o: 1 is called a transition map and is denoted by <Po:{3. Example 1.2.3. One immediate example of a smooth manifold is again JRn or open subsets of JRn. These manifolds admit an atlas with a single chart. So the condition on transition maps is vacuously true. Example 1.2.4. In Example 1.1.4 we saw that sn is an n-manifold by exhibiting an atlas with two charts: (sn \ ( 0, . . . , 0, 1), h), (sn \ ( 0, . . . , 0, -1), h') where 1 h(xI,... ,xn+d = 1 (XI,... ,x n ) - Xn+l and h'(XI"",X n +1) = 1 (XI,...,xn). 1 + X n + 1 Thus to show that sn is a smooth manifold, we need to show that the transition maps h' 0 h- 1 and h 0 (h')-l are smooth. We will only check that

8 1. Perspectives on Manifolds h' 0 h- l is smooth. (The case h 0 (h')-l is analogous.) Here h-I(YI, . . . , Yn) = ( 2YI 2Yn -1 + Y + · · · + Y ) 1 + Y + · · · + Y ' · . · , 1 + Y + · · · + y' 1 + Y + · · · + Y ' h' 0 h -1 (Yb . . . , Yn) = 2 1 2 (Yb . · . , Yn). YI + · · · + Y n It follows that h' 0 h- l is smooth except at the origin where the composition of maps is not defined. Thus sn is a smooth manifold. Example 1.2.5. In the exercises you proved that the product of manifolds is a manifold. Since the product of smooth maps is smooth, the product of smooth manifolds is a smooth manifold. It follows that 'Jrn is a smooth manifold. In calculus we learn about differentiable maps from JRn to JRm. Some concepts extend to manifolds. Definition 1.2.6. Let M be a manifold with atlas {(Mo:, <Po:)} and let N be a manifold with atlas {(N,B, 1/J,B)}. We say that the map f : M  N is C q ifVa,{3, the map 1/J,B 0 f 0 <P o: I (where it is defined) is C q . Definition 1.2.7. A Cq-map between Cq-manifolds with a Cq-inverse is called a Cq-diffeomorphism. A Coo-diffeomorphism is simply called a diffeo- morphism. Remark 1.2.8. The map f : JR  JR given by f(x) = x 3 is a Coo-map but is not a diffeomorphism because its derivative is singular at o. (In fact, it is not even a Cl-diffeomorphism.) Definition 1.2.9. Two Cq-manifolds are considered equivalent if there is a Cq-diffeomorphism between them. In the exercises, you will extend the notion of submanifold, manifold with boundary, and submanifold of a manifold with boundary to the DIFF category, that is, to the setting in which manifolds are considered in this section. In the DIFF category we are interested in smooth maps between mani- folds. Example 1.2.10. Projection from 'Jr2 = Sl X Sl onto the second factor is a smooth map between manifolds. In Appendix A, we introduce the notion of transversality in the category of DIFF manifolds. Another concept that is best described in this category is that of a Morse function. We discuss the concept in more detail in Appendix B but provide the basic definition here. 
/*** End Page =19= ***/
/*** Page =20= ***/
Exercises 9 Definition 1.2.11. Let M be a Cq-manifold for q > 1, x E M, and (Ma, 4Ja) a chart with x E Ma. We say that x is a critical point of a function f : M -t JR if it is a critical point of f 0 4J a 1. Definition 1.2.12. A critical point of a function g : JRn -t JR is non- degenerate if the Hessian of g is non-singular at x. For M, x, (Ma, 4Ja), f as above, we say that x is a non-degenerate critical point of f if it is a non-degenerate critical point of f 0 4J a 1. Remark 1.2.13. In the exercises, you will verify that these two definitions do not depend on the chart used. Definition 1.2.14. A Morse function on a manifold M is a smooth function f : M -t JR that satisfies the following: . f has only non-degenerate critical points; . distinct critical points of f take on distinct values. Figure 1.10. Projection onto the z-axis. Example 1.2.15. The torus pictured in Figure 1.10 sits in JR3 and projec- tion onto the third coordinate defines a function. This function has four critical points: (1) a minimum; (2) two saddle points; (3) a maximum. You will verify in the exercises that all these critical points are non-degenerate. Since they occur at distinct levels, this function is a Morse function. Exercises Exercise 1. Verify that the definitions of critical point and non-degenerate critical point for a function f : M -t JR are independent of the chart used. 
/*** End Page =20= ***/
/*** Page =21= ***/
10 1. Perspectives on Manifolds Exercise 2. Verify that the critical points of the function given in Example 1.2.15 are non-degenerate. Exercise 3. Find other Morse functions on the torus by drawing other pictures representing the torus in JR3. Exercise 4. Compute the quantity #minima+#maxima-#saddles for the Morse function in Example 1.2.15 and the Morse functions from Exercise 3. Exercise 5. Extend the notions of submanifold, manifold with boundary, and submanifold of a manifold with boundary to the DIFF category. 1.3. Oriented Manifolds The notion of orientation allows us to partition manifolds into two types: orient able and non-orientable. We introduce the notion here in the DIFF category, though analogous notions exist in some other categories, most notably TOP (discussed above) and TRIANG (discussed below). Definition 1.3.1. A Coo-manifold M with boundary is orientable if it has an atlas such that the Jacobians of all transition maps have positive deter- minant. Otherwise M is non-orientable. An orientation of M is such an atlas. We often write (M, {c/Ja}) to denote an oriented manifold. Example 1.3.2. The annulus A = Sl x (-1,1) is orientable. It can be covered by two charts: { ( { (e ix , t): -  < x < 5; , -1 < t < 1 } , 4>1) , ( { (e ix , t) : 3; < x < 9; , -1 < t < 1 } , 4>2) } where c/Ji((e ix , t)) = (x, t). The transition maps are  -l (( t)) = { (x + 21r, t) if -  < x <  , '1-'2 0 '1-'1 x, (x, t) if 3; < x < 5; and 4>1 0 4>"2 1 «x, t)) = { :,) 211", t) if 711" < X < 911" 4 4 ' if 3; <x< 5; . Thus the Jacobians of all transition maps (where they are defined) have positive determinant. Example 1.3.3. The Mobius band is the surface with boundary obtained by identifying two sides of a rectangle, as pictured in Figure 1.11. It is non- orientable. Intuitively speaking, this is because in an orient able surface, there is a well-defined notion of, for instance, "above", or "being to the

1.3. Oriented Manifolds 11 right". (You can make sense out of this in JR2. The condition on Jacobians guarantees that the notion patches together correctly on overlapping charts.) Now consider the core curve of the Mobius band, as pictured in Figure 1.12, and imagine a curve "above" or "to the right" of the core curve. Such a curve does not exist, and so the Mobius band is non-orientable. a a Figure 1.11. The AlJobius band. a a core Figure 1.12. The core of the AlJobius band. Let M be a differentiable manifold with two orientations (M, {cpo.}) and (M, {'l/;{3}). The subset of M on which cpo.o'l/; {3 1 is defined and has a Jacobian with a positive determinant is the subset where the orientations of (M, {cpo.}) and (M, {'l/;{3}) are said to coincide. The subset where CPo. 0 'l/; {3 1 is defined and has a Jacobian with a negative determinant is the subset where the orientations of (M, {cpo.}) and (M, {'l/;{3}) are said to differ. These two sets are open. Thus for a connected manifold M, two orientations either coincide on all of M or differ on all of M. Given an oriented manifold (M, { CPo.} ), we can create an oriented man- ifold (M, {'l/;o.}) for which the orientations differ on all of M. Indeed, for each CPo. : Uo. ---t JRn, defined by CPo.(x) = (Xl, X2, . . . , x n ), we substitute 'l/;o. : Uo. ---t JRn, defined by 'l/;o.(x) = (-Xl, X2, . . . , x n ). The resulting orien- tation is called the opposite orientation of the original one. We denote the resulting oriented manifold by - M. If M is an oriented manifold with boundary, then there is a natural orientation on 8M, called the induced orientation of 8M. See for instance [48]. We will not discuss the technicalities here. On a related note, given an oriented manifold M, we sometimes assign an orientation to an orient able submanifold. When the dimension of the submanifold is one less than the dimension of the manifold in which it lies,

12 1. Perspectives on Manifolds then choosing an orientation on the submanifold is equivalent to choosing a smoothly varying normal direction. For details see [48]. Definition 1.3.4. For oriented Coo-manifolds (M, {4>0}), (N, {'l/J,B}) of the same dimension, a smooth map h : M --t N is orientation-preserving if the Jacobians of the maps 'l/J,B 0 h 0 4> 0 1 (where they are defined) all have positive determinant.

The map f Sl --t Sl given by f(e 27rix ) orient at ion- reversing. e 47rix IS e - 27rix IS In a non-orientable manifold M each chart defines a local orientation. If c is a closed I-dimensional submanifold of M, then the transition maps for those charts of M that meet c mayor may not have Jacobians with positive determinants. If there is an atlas for M for which all charts that meet c have transition maps whose Jacobians have positive determinants, then we say that c is an orientation-preserving closed I-dimensional submanifold of M. If there is no such atlas, then c is an orientation-reversing closed I-dimensional submanifold of M. In the exercises, you will prove the following: Lemma 1.3.7. The manifold M is non-orientable if and only if M contains an orientation-reversing closed I-dimensional submanifold. Exercises Exercise 1. Show that sn is an orient able manifold. Exercise 2.

Triangulated Manifolds In this section we consider manifolds in the TRIANG category. The defini- tions that lay the foundation for this study (simplicial complexes and related notions) are discussed in greater detail in [148]. See also [102]. Note that in Definitions 1.4.12 and 1.4.13 we make a subtle departure from the traditional definitions. This is in line with a contemporary view of

1.4. Triangulated Manifolds 13 triangulations. For more detail, see Chapter 5, where we will reconcile the two notions. Definition 1.4.1. Denote the (k + I)-tuple in JRk+l with i-th entry 1 and all other entries 0 by Vi. The set { aovo+...+akVk: ao > o,...,a k > o,ta;,=l } t=O is called the standard (closed) k-simplex and is denoted by [vo,..., Vk] or simply by [s]. The dimension of the standard k-simplex is k. The set { aoVo + · · · + ak Vk : ao > 0, · · · , ak > 0, t a;, = I } t=O is called the standard open k-simplex and is denoted by (vo, . . . , Vk) or simply by (s). We also call (s) the interior of [s]. Example 1.4.2. The standard O-simplex is the point 1 E JR. This is also the standard open O-simplex. Definition 1.4.3. A k-simplex in a topological space X is a continuous map I : [s] --+ X such that [s] is the standard k-simplex and the restriction II(s) is a homeomorphism onto its image. An open k-simplex is the restriction of a k-simplex to the interior (s) of [s]. Abusing notation slightly, we will often refer to the image of I as a k-simplex. Example 1.4.4. The standard I-simplex is homeomorphic to an interval. See Figures 1.13 and 1.14. Figure 1.13. The standard I-simplex.

Figure 1.15 depicts a 2-simplex. Example 1.4.6. The standard 3-simplex is a tetrahedron with vertices at (1,0,0,0), (0, 1,0,0), (0,0, 1,0), and (0,0,0, 1). Figure 1.16 depicts a 3- simplex.

The dimension of the face is k - j. The faces of the k-simplex f : [s] --+ X are the restriction maps f![t] for [t] a face of the standard k-simplex [s]. A O-dimensional face of a simplex is also called a vertex. A I-dimensional face of a simplex is also called an edge.

1.4. Triangulated Manifolds 15 Example 1.4.8. A O-simplex has only itself as a face. Example 1.4.9. The standard I-simplex [VO, VI] (and hence alII-simplices) has itself as a I-dimensional face. It also has two O-dimensional faces, [vo] and [VI]. Example 1.4.10. A 2-simplex has one 2-dimensional, three I-dimensional, and three O-dimensional faces. Example 1.4.11. A 3-simplex has one 3-dimensional, four 2-dimensional, six I-dimensional, and four O-dimensional faces. Definition 1.4.12 (Simplicial complex). A simplicial complex based on the topological space X is a set of simplices K = {I : [s] --+ X} in the topological space X such that (1) \j simplices I E K, all faces of I are in K; (2) \j simplices 11,12 E K, im(/ll(sl»)nim(/21(s2») ::I 0 ==* im(/ll(sl») = im(/21(s2»). The dimension of a simplicial complex K is the supremum of the di- mensions of the simplices in K. We denote the union of the images of the simplices in K by IKI and calliKI the underlying space of K. For examples see Figures 1.17, 1.18, and 1.19. Traditionally, one also requires that each closed simplex be embedded and that two distinct closed simplices meet in at most one face. We do not make these assumptions here! Figure 1.17.

For f : [s] ---t Mann-simplex in K, the pair (im f, f-l) is called a simplicial chart of the triangulation. In this context, we often write K = {fa} and denote the collection of all charts on M by {(imfa,fI)}. We also refer to fa as a simplex of M. There are related categories of manifolds (piecewise linear (PL), combi- natorial) that we will not discuss here. Suffice it to say that some distinctions are subtle. Example 1.4.14. Figure 1.20 depicts a triangulation of S2. Example 1.4.15. Figure 1.21 depicts a triangulation of 1f2 with two 2- simplices. Example 1.4.16. Figure 1.22 depicts a triangulated cube. It can be inter- preted as a portion of a triangulation of 1f3. We obtain a triangulation of 1f3 by identifying eight appropriately chosen reflections of this cube. The resulting triangulation contains forty 3-simplices. Theorem 1.4.17. Every compact I-manifold admits a triangulation.

A proof can be found in [101]. This theorem has been put to extensive use in the study of 3-manifolds. In view of Lemma 1.4.28 below, it allows us to build 3-manifolds by identi- fying 3-simplices along faces. In Chapter 5 we will see a brief introduction to normal surface theory (after Wolfgang Haken) where this point of view bears fruit. Definition 1.4.20. Let K and L be simplicial complexes. We say that a continuous map 4J : IKI ---t ILl is a simplicial map if for every simplex f in K, there is a simplex 9 in L such that 4J 0 f = g. Informally speaking, a simplicial map maps simplices to simplices, but the latter might be of lower dimension than the former. Example 1.4.21. Figure 1.23 depicts a simplicial map from the top sim- plicial complex (containing four triangles) to the bottom simplicial complex (containing two edges): The two vertices on the left go to the left vertex below, the two vertices in the middle go to the middle vertex below, and the two vertices on the right go to the right vertex below. Extend this map of vertices linearly over the 2-simplices to obtain a simplicial map. Non-Example. A map that is not simplicial is depicted in Figure 1.24. It maps the top simplicial complex (containing four triangles) to the bottom simplicial complex (containing one edge) via nearest point projection (in JR2).

20 1. Perspectives on Manifolds Figure 1.25. A subcomplex of a simplicial complex. One concept that is easily defined in the TRIANG category is the fol- lowing: Definition 1.4.26. The Euler characteristic of a finite simplicial complex K of dimension k is computed via the following formula: k X(K) = ::) -l)i#{simplices of dimension i in K}. i=O Remark 1.4.27. In fact, Definition 1.4.26 is well-defined for the underlying space of a simplicial complex. This can be established via a computation involving the notion of homology from algebraic topology. The standard k-simplex lies in JRk+l and is thus a topological space. Suppose that (M, K) is a triangulated k-manifold and consider a collection C that is the disjoint union of copies of standard k-simplices, one copy for each k-simplex f in K. Now construct a quotient space from C as follows: We identify points in the collection C if and only if the corresponding points x E [8] and y E [t] for f : [8]  M and g : [t]  M in K satisfy f(x) = g(y). We leave the proof of the following lemma as an exercise. Lemma 1.4.28. The quotient space M' (in the quotient topology) is home- omorphic to the topological manifold M. The observation in Lemma 1.4.28 allows us to think of triangulated n-manifolds as objects that are constructed out of standard simplices by identifying faces. Example 1.4.29. Figure 1.26 describes a triangulation ofS 3 . The labeling gives the identification of the edges. 2-dimensional faces are identified if all three of their edges are identified.

Euclidean geometry and the other structures now also considered geometries provide insight into manifolds. We will assume a basic familiarity with Euclidean geometry in this section. In Chapter 7, we will develop the basics of hyperbolic geometry. While in this section we focus on Euclidean manifolds, the definitions carryover verbatim with the term "Euclidean" replaced by the term "hyperbolic" in order to

22 1. Perspectives on Manifolds define hyperbolic manifolds. For more on geometric 3-manifolds, see [145], [154], [153], or [126]. Definition 1.5.1. An isometry is an invertible map between metric spaces that preserves distances. A Euclidean isometry, i.e., an isometry f : jRn --* jRn, is also called a rigid motion. Definition 1.5.2. A Euclidean manifold is a topological manifold M with an atlas that satisfies the additional requirement that the transition maps are restrictions of Euclidean isometries. We often write (M, {a}) to denote a Euclidean manifold. The more general term is that of a geometric manifold. There the ad- ditional requirement is that the transition maps are isometries in a given geometry. Example 1.5.3. An immediate example of a Euclidean manifold is again jRn. This manifold admits an atlas with a single chart. So the condition on transition maps is vacuously true. Example 1.5.4. It follows from the description of 'Jfn given in Example 1.1.5 that 'Jfn is a Euclidean manifold. Definition 1.5.5. Given two Euclidean manifolds (M, a), (N, (3), a map f : M --* N is an isometry if Va, {3 the maps  a 1 0 f o"p{3 are restrictions of Euclidean isometries. Definition 1.5.6. Two Euclidean manifolds M, N are considered equivalent if there is an invertible isometry h : M --* N. Remark 1.5.7. On a connected Euclidean manifold there is a well-defined metric. Metric concepts such as completeness, diameter, volume, etc., are thus defined for Euclidean manifolds. Exercises Exercise 1. Show that among Euclidean 2-manifolds there are infinitely many inequivalent 2-tori. Exercise 2. The definition of Euclidean manifolds extends to manifolds with boundary. Show that among Euclidean manifolds with boundary there are infinitely many inequivalent annuli. Exercise 3. Show that SI is a Euclidean manifold. Exercise 4*.

1.6. Connected Sums 23 1.6. Connected Sums The following two notions are fundamental to the study of manifolds. Definition 1.6.1. Two continuous maps fo, f1 : M --* N are homotopic if there is a continuous map H : M x [0,1] --* N such that H(x,O) = fo and H(x, 1) = f1(X) \Ix E M. The map H is called a homotopy between fo and fl. Definition 1.6.2. Two embeddings fo, f1 : M --* N are isotopic if there is a continuous map H : M x [0,1] --* N such that H(x,O) = fo and H(x,l) = f1(X) \Ix E M and such that \It E [0,1], the map ft defined by H( , t) is an embedding. The map H is called an isotopy between fo and fl. Two submanifolds 80,81 of M are isotopic if their inclusion maps are isotopic. The following two theorems are due to Gugenheim (see [47]) in the TRIANG category and are also a consequence of the Isotopy Uniqueness of Regular Neighborhoods Theorem due to Rourke and Sanderson (see [128]). They are fundamental theorems in the study of n-manifolds. We will need these theorems in the discussion of Definition 1.6.5. Theorem 1.6.3. Every orientation-preserving homeomorphism of an n-ball or n-sphere is isotopic to the identity. We will prove a special case of Theorem 1.6.3, known as the Alexander Trick, in Section 2.5. Theorem 1.6.4. If B 1 , B 2 are n-balls in the interior of a connected n- manifold M, then there is an isotopy f : M x I --* M such that f( ,0)IB1 is the identity and f( ,1)I B 1 is a homeomorphism onto B 2 . The proof of Theorem 1.6.4 is left as an exercise. Theorem 1.6.4 ensures that Definition 1.6.5 is well-defined. Orientations also playa subtle role in Definition 1.6.5. Definition 1.6.5. Let M 1 , M 2 be n-manifolds. Delete small open n-balls B 1 from M 1 and B 2 from M 2 - Identify M1 and M 2 along the resulting (n - I)-sphere boundary components. This results in an n-manifold called a connected sum of M 1 and M 2 and is denoted by M 1 #M2. In the case that M 1 and M 2 are oriented, we further require that the identification of the boundaries of B 1 and B 2 be via an orientation-reversing homeomorphism (with respect to the induced boundary orientations on 8B1, 8B2). The connected sum M 1 #M2 is trivial if either M 1 or M 2 is sn. Other- wise, M 1 #M2 is non-trivial. 
/*** End Page =34= ***/
/*** Page =35= ***/
24 1. Perspectives on Manifolds In deleting the small open n-balls, we are making a choice, but Theorem 1.6.4 ensures that this choice is inconsequential. If M 1 , M 2 are oriented, then Theorem 1.6.3 tells us that any two choices of identification of 8B1 and -8B 2 are isotopic and it follows that the manifolds obtained via this identification are homeomorphic. Thus for oriented manifolds M 1 , M 2 , there is a unique connected sum (Le., connected sum is well-defined in the oriented category) . For orient able (but not oriented) manifolds it is possible to have two non- homeomorphic connected sums of M 1 and M 2 . Specifically, endow Ml, M 2 with orientations and consider M1#M2 versus M 1 #(-M2). For examples of oriented 3-manifolds M1, M2 for which M1#M2 =I M1#(-M 2 ), see [63]. If at least one of M1, M 2 , say M1, is non-orientable, then there is, in fact, a unique connected sum M1 #M2. Indeed, this is because every non-orientable n-manifold M contains an orientation-reversing closed 1- dimensional su bmanifold (by Lemma 1.3.7). Isotoping a small n- ball along such a I-dimensional submanifold reverses the local orientation on an open neighborhood of the n-ball B 1 and hence also the induced boundary orien- tation of (M1 \B 1 )\8M 1 . This isotopy extends to an isotopy between the two possibilities for connected sums of M 1 and M 2 , thereby demonstrating that they are homeomorphic. In the case of surfaces, the situation, is simpler. Every oriented sur- face 8 admits an orientation-reversing homeomorphism h : 8 --* 8. Thus for any pair 81, 8 2 of oriented surfaces, 81 #8 2 = 81 #h(82) = 81 # - 82. Hence for orientable surfaces, the choice of identifying homeomorphism is inconsequential and the connected sum is unique. A word on notation: We denote repeated connected sums by M = M1 # · · · #M n . We leave it as an exercise to show that connected sum of manifolds is associative and commutative. (An example to consider is the following: The connected sum of four 3-manifolds M 1 ,. . . , M4 can be ob- tained in several ways. For instance, take the connected sum by removing three small 3-balls from M 1 , one small 3-ball from M 2 , M 3 , M4 and identify- ing the resulting boundary components of M 1 with those of M 2 , M3, M4. On the other hand, take the connected sum by removing one small 3-ball from M 1 and M4, two small 3-balls from M 2 and M3 and identifying the result- ing boundary component of M 1 with one of M 2 's, the resulting boundary component of M4 with one of M3 's, and the remaining resulting boundary components of M 2 and M3 with each other. Figure 1.27 hints at why the repeated connected sum is nevertheless well-defined.) Definition 1.6.6 (Prime n-manifold). An n-manifold M is prime if M = M 1 #M2 implies that either M1 or M 2 is the n-sphere, i.e., that the connected sum M = M1 #M2 is trivial.

The key idea, except in the TRIANG category, is the following: Choose a collection G of invertible maps of IR n that is closed under group operations and require the transition maps to belong to G. The PL category is similar to the TRIANG category, but there are subtle differences that we do not wish to discuss here. There are natural maps from all the categories considered here to TOP (in each case, it is the forgetful functor). Amazingly, for 2-manifolds and 3-manifolds, these maps are isomorphisms in the case of DIFF and TRI- ANG! This means that every topological 3-manifold admits a triangulation. 
/*** End Page =36= ***/
/*** Page =37= ***/
26 1. Perspectives on Manifolds Furthermore, any two triangulations of a topological 3-manifold admit a common subdivision. Much of the work establishing the equivalence of the categories TOP and TRIANG is due to E. Moise and R. H. Bing. See [102] and [101]. It deserves to be mentioned that this equivalence of categories is not true for higher-dimensional manifolds. This was first shown by Milnor. He exhibited examples of 7-spheres with distinct differentiable structures, thus demonstrating that DIFF =f=. TOP for 7-dimensional manifolds. To date, it is unknown whether there are smooth structures on 8 4 that are not diffeo- morphic. A candidate for an "exotic" smooth structure on the 4-sphere was given by Scharlemann. See [132]. Decades later it was proved by Akbulut that this smooth structure is in fact diffeomorphic to the standard smooth structure on the 4-sphere. See [5]. The advantage of the equivalence of the categories TOP, DIFF, and TRIANG in the case of 3-manifolds is that we can introduce a concept or prove a theorem in the category that best suits the concept or theorem. For instance, we introduced the notion of a Morse function in the DIFF cate- gory and we introduced the notion of Euler characteristic in the TRIANG category. The notions can be introduced in the other categories as well, but the definitions are necessarily more cumbersome, so we will not do so here. We will be moving back and forth between categories when this is convenient. When categories are equivalent, it is acceptable, though not es- thetically pleasing, to prove theorems using concepts introduced in distinct categories. Recall, for instance, the definition of Euler characteristic in Section 1.4. We will use the notion of Euler characteristic in the other categories as well. For instance, given a smooth surface 8, we can compute the Euler character- istic by triangulating the surface and taking the specified alternating sum. If 8 contains a finite graph r such that 8\r consists of a finite number of disks, then the Euler characteristic can be calculated directly from rand 8\r. You will prove this in the exercises. We can compute the Euler characteristic not only for closed surfaces but also punctured surfaces. Specifically, since points have Euler characteristic 1, the result of removing n points from a surface 8 is X( 8) - n. One theorem we will use repeatedly, stated here in the case of 2-manifolds, is the following: Theorem 1.7.1 (Poincare-Hopf Index Theorem). Let 8 be a surface and let h : 8 --* 1R be a Morse function. Then X(8) = #(minima of h) + #(maxima of h) - #(saddles of h). For a proof of this therem, see [48].

Chapter  Surfaces Topological 2-manifolds, also known as surfaces, are well understood. See [93]. We here give a brief overview of what is known. There are additional structures on surfaces that add interest and provide tools for the study of 3-manifolds. See Sections 2.5 and 2.6 of this chapter. For an in-depth treatment of the topics in Sections 2.5 and 2.6, see [25] and [39]. 2.1. A Few Facts about I-Manifolds It is not hard to show that the only compact connected I-manifolds are the circle and the interval. (You will prove this in the exercises.) In this chapter we will often consider I-dimensional submanifolds of surfaces. In subsequent chapters we will consider I-dimensional and 2-dimensional submanifolds of 3-manifolds. Definition 2.1.1. A simple closed curve in a surface S is a compact con- nected I-dimensional submanifold of S without boundary. A simple arc in a surface S is a compact connected I-dimensional submanifold of S with non-empty boundary. Remark 2.1.2. The only compact connected I-manifold without boundary is the circle. So we also think of a simple closed curve in a surface S as an embedding of the circle into S. The only compact connected I-manifold with non-empty boundary is the interval. So we also think of a simple arc in S as an embedding of the interval into S. One of the fundamental theorems about simple closed curves in surfaces, which we will not prove but which we state here from a topologist's point - 29

30 2. Surfaces of view, is the following: Theorem 2.1.3 (Jordan Curve Theorem). If c is a simple closed curve in ]R2, then ]R2\c consists of two components: one open annulus and one open disk. If c is a simple closed curve in S2, then S2\c consists of two open disks. AlII-manifolds are orientable. (See Exercise 2 below.) In the case of a simple closed curve, we can think of an orientation as a direction in which the circle is traversed. In what follows we will be interested in assigning orientations to points of intersection of I-dimensional submanifolds in a surface. Figure 2.1. Two points of intersection with the same orientation. Figure 2.2. Two oppositely oriented points of intersection. Definition 2.1.4. Let a, b be simple closed curves in a surface S. We say that a, b intersect transversely and write a rh b if \Ix E a n b, there is a chart (U-y, <p-y) with <p-y(U-y) = ]R2 such that <P-y maps x to (0,0), a to the x-axis, and b to the y-axis. It is not hard to see that in an oriented surface S, the chart (U-y, <p-y) can be chosen to be in the orientation of S. (Postcompose with a reflection in ]R2.) It is harder to see that for any pair (a, b) of simple closed curves in a surface S, a can be isotoped to a simple closed curve a' so that a' rh b.

An orientation for a point x E a n b is the assignment :!:1 obtained as follows: Let (U-y, <p-y) be a chart in the orientation of S with <p-y(U-y) == ]R2 such that <P-y maps x to (0,0), a to the x-axis, and b to the y-axis. If <P-yla and <P-ylb are both orientation-preserving or both orientation-reversing, then the orientation on x is +1. Otherwise, it is -1. See Figures 2.1 and 2.2. Definition 2.1.6. Let a, b be oriented simple closed curves in the oriented surface S such that a rh b. The sum of the orientations on points in a n b is called the oriented intersection number of a and b. A straightforward but technical result that can be found for instance in [48] is the following: Theorem 2.1.7. Suppose that a, b, a', b' are oriented simple closed curves in an oriented surface S. Suppose further that a is homotopic to a', b is homotopic to b', a rh b, and a' rh b'. Then the oriented intersection number of a and b is equal to the oriented intersection number of a' and b'. Definition 2.1.8. For homotopy classes [a], [b], the oriented intersection number, [a] · [b], is the oriented intersection number of transverse represen- tatives of the classes. In particular, for a homotopy class [c], the oriented intersection number of [c] with itself is the oriented intersection number of representatives c, c' of [c] that intersect transversely. Example 2.1.9. In 1f2, the simple closed curve m == SI x {O} is homotopic to a disjoint simple closed curve m'. Thus [m] · [m] is O. Exercises Exercise 1. Show that the only compact connected I-manifolds are the circle and the interval. Exercise 2. Prove that alII-manifolds are orientable. Exercise 3. Generalize Example 2.1.9 to arbitrary oriented surfaces. 2.2. Classification of Surfaces In Chapter 1 we discussed several examples of surfaces, among them the sphere, the torus, the projective plane, the disk, and the annulus. The

32 2. Surfaces sphere and the torus are orientable, whereas the projective plane is not. Two more examples of surfaces deserve to be pointed out: (1) The Klein bottle. The Klein bottle can be obtained by identifying the sides of a square as in Figure 2.3. We will denote the Klein bottle by J[{2. The Klein bottle contains a Mobius band (see Figure 2.4) and is hence non-orientable. (2) The connected sum of 9 tori is called the genus 9 surface. b a a b Figure 2.3.

A simple closed curve c in S is separating if S\c has two components. Otherwise it is non-separating. A simple closed curve c in a surface S is inessential if c is separating and a component of S\c is a disk or annulus. The curve c is essential if it is not inessential. A curve c is non-separating if and only if its complement is connected. Since connectedness is equivalent to path connectedness for manifolds, it

2.2. Classification of Surfaces 33 o I I I I , 0: , \ \ \ \ Figure 2.5. The genus 2 surface as a connected sum of two 2-tori. follows that c is non-separating if and only if there is some other simple closed curve that intersects c exactly once. Lemma 2.2.2. The closed surface S is prime if and only if 8 contains no essential separating simple closed curve. Proof. If 8 = 8 1 #82 is a non-trivial connected sum, then it contains a copy of the curve along which 8 1 \ (disk), 8 2 \ (disk) were identified. See the curve pictured in Figure 2.5. Conversely, if a simple closed curve c in 8 is essential and separating, then neither component of S\c is a disk. Capping off (Le., taking the union of) these two components with closed disks creates 81 =F S2, 82 =F S2 such that 8 = 81 #82. 0 Example 2.2.3. The sphere is a prime surface. This is a consequence of the Jordan Curve Theorem, which tells us that an essential curve as in Lemma 2.2.2 can't exist. The Klein bottle is not a prime surface. The curve pictured in Figure 2.6 cuts the Klein bottle into two open Mobius bands. Attaching disks to the remnants of the curve in these Mobius bands produces two projective planes. Hence the Klein bottle is the connected sum of two projective planes. The annulus is not a prime surface. It is the connected sum of two disks. More generally, a compact surface with boundary is not prime. It is the connected sum of a closed surface and a finite number of disks. Triangulations have proved useful in the study of surfaces. Most im- portantly, they allow us to consider a compact surface as the identification space of a finite number of triangles; see Lemma 1.4.28. For many applica- tions, it is expedient to consider not only triangles but other polygons. In this context, a polygon is a convex disk in ]R2 whose boundary is partitioned into edges. Specifically, it is often preferable to first identify the triangles to a single polygon. The surface is obtained from this polygonal representa- tion by identifying appropriate pairs of edges. In Chapter 1 we encountered

34 2. Surfaces a - - - - J \ \ ' - - - - a Figure 2.6. Ir<? = IRP2#IRP2. polygonal representations of the torus and the projective plane. Above, we encountered a polygonal representation of the Klein bottle. Lemma 2.2.4. Every compact surface admits a polygonal representation. Proof. Recall from Chapter 1 that every surface 8 admits a triangulation (8, K). The dual graph of K is the graph obtained by associating a vertex to each 2-simplex of K and an edge to each I-simplex of K such that the vertices incident to this edge are the vertex or vertices associated with the 2-simplex or 2-simplices in which the I-simplex lies. A spanning tree of a graph is a tree that contains all vertices of the graph. Let T be a spanning tree of the dual graph of K. (It exists because K and hence also its dual graph are finite.) In the exercises, you will use induction on the number of vertices in T to construct a polygon P (in JR2) from a finite collection of standard 2-simplices (in IR 3 ), corresponding to the 2-simplices of K, such that the result of identifying appropriate edges of P is the surface 8. This provides a polygonal representation of 8. 0 Lemma 2.2.5. The sphere, the projective plane, and the torus are prime surfaces. Proof. Case 1. The sphere is prime. See Example 2.2.3. Case 2. The projective plane. We argue by contradiction. If IRp 2 is not prime, then it contains a separating essential simple closed curve c guaranteed by Lemma 2.2.2. We analyze this curve in the polygonal representation of IRp 2 given in Figure 2.7. General position, a consequence of Theorem A.0.19, allows us to assume that c misses the vertices of the polygonal representation and meets the edges transversely.

2.2. Classification of Surfaces 35 a a Figure 2.7. A simple closed curve in RP2. If a subarc, a, of c in this polygonal representation of IRp2 cobounds a disk D together with a subarc, b, of an edge of the boundary of the polygon, then we can assume that a is an outermost such arc, Le., that the disk D cobounded by a and b has interior disjoint from c. The disk D describes an isotopy that moves a across D to coincide with b and then off of b just beyond b. A disk cut off by an outermost arc is shaded in Figure 2.7. The effect of the isotopy is pictured in Figure 2.8. a a Figure 2.8. The same simple closed curve in RP2. Proceeding in this manner, we can remove all subarcs of c cobounding disks with subarcs of edges of the polygon. After this isotopy, c consists en- tirely of subarcs that connect distinct edges of our polygonal representation of IRp2. If c consists of only one such arc, then c is non-separating (see Fig- ure 2.10 where the dashed arc represents a simple closed curve intersecting c once), so this is impossible. If c consists of more than one arc, consider the two outermost such arcs as in Figure 2.9. The way in which the edges of our polygonal representative of IRp2 are identified forces the endpoints of these two arcs to be identified pairwise. Thus c consists of exactly these two arcs. In this case c cuts IRp2 into a Mobius band and a disk and is hence not essential, so this is also impossible. Hence there is no essential simple closed curve, whence the projective plane is prime.

36 2. Surfaces a a Figure 2.9. A simple closed curve in RP2. a a Figure 2.10. A non-separating simple closed curve in RP2. Case 3. The torus is prime. We leave this case as an exercise. o Lemma 2.2.6. The sphere, the torus, and the projective plane are the only closed prime surfaces. Proof. Given a surface S, we consider a polygonal representation of S with polygon P. It may happen that P has two adjacent edges as pictured in Figure 2.11. In this case we modify P by identifying the two edges to obtain a polygon with fewer edges. We continue to denote this polygon by P. It may also happen that P has two adjacent edges as pictured in Figure 2.12. If there are no other edges, then S is a projective plane. If there are other edges, then the curve represented by the dotted arc in Figure 2.12 must cut off a disk to the other side. (Otherwise S would not be prime.) Hence S is again IRp 2 . We may assume, therefore, in the following, that pairs of edges of P that are identified are not adjacent. Let c be a simple closed curve in S that is realized by an arc in P connecting a pair of edges that are identified. (In particular, c intersects no other remnants of edges of P in S.) Suppose first that c is separating. Since S is prime, one of these components, say 82, must

This disk meets remnants of edges of P. This implies that there is a polygonal representation of S with fewer edges. Now suppose that c is non-separating. Let a be a simple closed curve that intersects c once; see Figure 2.13. Furthermore, let C(cUa) be a collar neighborhood (see Appendix A and Figure 2.13) of c U a. We leave it as an exercise to show that C(c U a) is one of three things: a torus minus a disk, a Klein bottle minus a disk, or a Mobius band minus a disk. In each case, the boundary curve(s) of C(cUa) must bound disks in S. (Otherwise S would be a connected sum.) The case of a Klein bottle can not occur as the Klein bottle is not prime. Thus S is a torus or a projective plane. By choosing a polygonal representation of S with the smallest number of edges we establish the lemma. 0

Every closed connected surface is homeomorphic to either a sphere or a connected sum of tori or a connected sum of projective planes. Definition 2.2.8. For an orientable surface, the number of tori in this connected sum is called the genus. For a non-orientable surface the number of projective planes in this connected sum is called the genus. The proof of Theorem 2.2.7 duplicates the reasoning in the proof of Lemma 2.2.6. However, instead of concluding, at certain points, as we could there, that S is a torus or a projective plane, we split off summands (IRp2 or 1f2). The fact that this strategy works, Le., that the procedure terminates, follows from considering the number of vertices in the polygonal representa- tion of the surface as summands are split off. In Exercise 3 below, you will prove that the number of vertices decreases as tori and projective planes are split off. The fact that an orientable surface is built from torus summands (and not projective planes) is immediate. The fact that a non-orient able surface can be built from projective planes follows from Exercise 2 below. Corollary 2.2.9. For S an orientable surface of genus g, x(S) = 2 - 2g. For S a non-orientable surface of genus g, x(S) = 1 - g. The Euler characteristic and orientability of a closed connected surface are two examples of topological invariants (quantities that are well-defined

2.3. Decompositions of Surfaces 39 for a topological manifold). Thus Corollary 2.2.9 tells us that Euler char- acteristic and orient ability are a complete set of topological invariants for surfaces. Our goal is to understand 3-manifolds. We hope to discover and prove a theorem analogous to Theorem 2.2.7 for 3-manifolds. Two of the most basic problems toward this endeavor are the following: Problem 2.2.10. List all possible 3-manifolds. Problem 2.2.11. Decide whether or not two given 3-manifolds are home- omorphic. In Chapter 3, we will discuss prime factorization of 3-manifolds. In the context of 3-manifolds, 2-spheres will take the place of the circles used with surfaces. There are other decompositions of 3-manifolds, involving surfaces other than 2-spheres that are also of interest. We will say more about this in Section 3.4. Exercises Exercise 1. Show that the torus is prime. Exercise 2. Let (8, K) and T be as in the proof of Lemma 2.2.4. Use induction on the number of vertices in T to construct a polygon P in IR 2 from a finite collection of standard 2-simplices in IR3 corresponding to the vertices in K such that the result of identifying appropriate edges of P is the surface 8. Exercise 3. Show that in the proof of Lemma 2.2.6, C(c U a) is either a punctured torus, punctured Klein bottle, or punctured Mobius band. Exercise 4. Prove that 1f2#IRP2 = IRP2#IRP2#IRP2. Exercise 5. Prove that if P is a polygonal representation of a surface 8 and 8 = 8 1 #82 is a non-trivial connected sum, then 8 1 and 82 admit polygonal representations whose polygons have fewer vertices than P. 2.3. Decompositions of Surfaces In the preceding section we saw that every surface admits a decomposition into its prime summands. Note that the prime decomposition of a surface given by Theorem 2.2.7 is not unique up to isotopy, though for orientable surfaces the summands are unique up to homeomorphism. See Figures 2.14 and 2.15. Specifically, for non-orientable surfaces there are other prime decompositions than those in Theorem 2.2.7, namely those involving tori, e.g., 1f2#IRP2 = IRP2#IRP2#IRP2.

There are other natural decompositions of surfaces. Here we will consider decompositions into pairs of pants. The thrice-punctured sphere, or pair of pants, forms an important building block for orientable surfaces. Of interest here is the fact that a pair of pants contains no essential simple closed curves. You will establish this property in the exercises. Definition 2.3.1. A pants decomposition of a compact surface S is a col- lection of pairwise disjoint simple closed curves {Cl,. . . , en} such that each component of S\ (Cl U · · · U c n ) is a pair of pants. Two pants decompositions are equivalent if they are isotopic. Pants decompositions of surfaces are not unique. See Figures 2.16 and 2.17.

Covering Spaces and Branched Covering Spaces When we discussed the torus in Chapter 1, we introduced it as a quotient space of }Rn. Underlying this description of the torus is a more general notion: Definition 2.4.1. Let p : E ---t B be a continuous map. The open set U c B is said to be evenly covered if p-l(U) is a disjoint union of open sets {U a } such that 'Va pluo: : U a ---t U is a homeomorphism.

The triple (E, B,p) is a covering if 'Vb E B there is an open set U c B with b E U that is evenly covered. The map p is called the covering map. Example 2.4.2. The triple (IR,SI,p), where p: IR ---t SI is given by p(x) = e 2 11"ix, is a covering. See Figure 2.18. ,.- - .... I .... ------ .... , 1 I , - -.... c:0 c:0  ,.- - .... ....

Example 2.4.4. The triple (sn, IRpn, p), where p : sn ---t IRpn is defined by p(x) = [x] = [-x] (the equivalence class containing x and -x), is a covering (cf. Section 1.1). Note that if p : E ---t B is a covering map, then p is a local homeomor- phism, but not conversely. For example, consider p : IR+ ---t Sl given by p(x) = e 2 11"ix. Then p is a local homeomorphism but not a covering map. Definition 2.4.5. Let (E, B,p) be a covering space. A homeomorphism t : E ---t E is a covering transformation if pot = p. Example 2.4.6. For n E Z the map t : IR ---t IR given by t(x) = x + n is a covering transformation for the covering in Example 2.4.2.

Example 2.4.8. The antipodal map of sn is a covering transformation for the covering in Example 2.4.4. You will show in the exercises that the covering transformations for a given covering space form a group. It is called the group of covering transformations. Example 2.4.9. The group of covering transformations for the covering space in Example 2.4.4 is Z/2. Indeed, only the identity map and the an- tipodal map are covering maps. To see this, note that if t is a covering transformation, then Vx E sn, there are only two options: either t(x) = x or t(x) = -x. Since t is continuous, these two options extend continuously over sn to either the identity map or the antipodal map. You will show in the exercises that the group of covering transforma- tions for the covering spaces in Examples 2.4.2 and 2.4.3 are Z and Z2, respectively. Lemma 2.4.10. If (E, B,p) is a covering, B is a compact connected sim- plicial complex, and for b E B, p-l(b) is finite, then X(E) = #{p-l(b)} · X(B). The proof of this lemma requires showing that #{p-l(b)} is constant and then counting simplices. There is a more general notion: Definition 2.4.11. Let E, B be manifolds, E' a submanifold of E, B' a submanifold of B, and p : E ---t B a continuous map. The quintet (E, E' , B, B' , p) is a branched covering if . pIE\E' : E\E' ---t B\B' is a covering map; . piE' : E' ---+ B' is a covering map. Here B' is called the branch locus and E' is called the ramification locus. Example 2.4.12. The quintet (<C, 0, <C, 0, f), where f(z) = zn, is a branched . coverIng. Example 2.4.13.

In this section we will see that on surfaces, homotopy classes of simple closed curves correspond to isotopy classes of simple closed curves. Definition 2.5.1. Let F be a surface and let C = {Cl, . . . , c n } be a collection of simple closed curves in F that have been isotoped to intersect in a minimal number of points. We say that C is filling if F\(CI U ... U c n ) is a union of disks. Example 2.5.2. The pair of curves on ']f2 pictured in Figure 2.20 is filling. Figure 2.20. A pair of filling curves in T 2 . Lemma 2.5.3 (Alexander Trick). Suppose that f : JI))n ---t JI))n is a homeo- morphism such that fl8ID>n is the identity. Then f is isotopic to the identity. Proof.

Suppose that F is a closed orientable surface and h : F ---t F is a homeomorphism. If h is homotopic to the identity, then h is isotopic to the identity.

If there is a disk that is co bounded by an arc in c and an arc in h( c), then we can use an innermost such disk to perform an isotopy that reduces the number of points of intersection between c and h( c) .

2.6. The Mapping Class Group 47 Now every component of h(c)\c is either entirely contained in ']f2\c or crosses the open annulus ']f2\c. In particular, the orientations of the points in c n h(c) are the same. Recall that [c] · [c] = O. By Theorem 2.1.7, [c] · [h(c)] = o. It follows that en h(c) = 0. Thus h(c) is contained in the annulus ']f2\c. Therefore, h(c) is isotopic to c, whence hl c is isotopic to id Ic. Consider the pair of filling curves {m, l} in Example 2.5.2. The above argument allows us to assume that, after isotopy, h( m) coincides with m. You will prove in the exercises that there is an isotopy fixing m after which land h(l) coincide, Le., that hlL is isotopic to id Il. Now consider the polygonal representation of ']f2 with four sides that identify to m U l. Then h defines a map on this square Q and hl8Q = id8Q. By the Alexander Trick, the map hlQ is isotopic to the identity. Thus h is isotopic to the identity. (This completes the proof in the case of the torus. ) 0 Exercises Exercise 1. For m, l, h as in the proof of Theorem 2.5.4, prove that there is an isotopy fixing m after which land h(l) coincide. Exercise 2. Find  filling pair of curves for the genus 2 surface. Exercise 3. Show that on any surface, homotopic simple closed curves are isotopic. 2.6. The Mapping Class Group Self-diffeomorphisms of surfaces are interesting in their own right but are of particular interest here because of their role in certain constructions on 3-manifolds (e.g., mapping tori (see Chapter 3) and the curve complex (see Chapter 7)). More specifically, it is not self-diffeomorphisms of a surface but isotopy classes of self-diffeomorphisms of a surface that play a role. For this reason we are interested in the mapping class group defined below. In the exercises, you will show that the set of all self-diffeomorphisms of a topological space forms a group. In the case of an oriented surface, we denote this group by Diffeo(S). You will also show that the set of orientation- preserving self-diffeomorphisms and the set of self-diffeomorphisms that are homotopic to the identity form normal subgroups. In the case of an oriented surface, we denote these groups by Diffeo+ (S) and Diffeoo (S), respectively. We will define the mapping class group in terms of diffeomorphisms. Homeomorphisms of surfaces are isotopic to diffeomorphisms; hence our definitions could equally well be made in terms of homeomorphisms. In 
/*** End Page =58= ***/
/*** Page =59= ***/
48 2. Surfaces particular, our definition of Dehn twist given below yields homeomorphisms rather than diffeomorphisms. However, these homeomorphisms can easily be smoothed. Definition 2.6.1. Let 8 be a compact orient able surface. The mapping class group of 8, denoted by MCQ(8) is Diffeo+(8)/ Diffeoo(8), the group of orientation-preserving self-diffeomorphisms of 8 modulo the subgroup con- sisting of self-diffeomorphisms of 8 homotopic to the identity. Lemma 2.6.2. The mapping class group of the torus is isomorphic to 8L(2, Z), the group of 2 x 2 matrices with integer coefficients and deter- minant 1. Proof. Given a simple closed curve, on ']f2, we define an integer vector i(,) = ([,] · [m], [,] · [b]). As we saw in the proof of Theorem 2.5.4, the vector i(,) completely de- termines the isotopy class of , on ']f2. Then, given a homeomorphism f E Homeo(']f2), we define the matrix Af, whose columns are the vectors i(f(l)) and i(f(m)). The proof of Theorem 2.5.4 shows that the matrix Af completely de- termines the isotopy class of f. In the exercises you will verify that the map 7} : f r-+ Af is a homomorphism from Homeo(']f2) to the group of integer matrices. In particular, the image of 7} is contained in GL(2, Z). Since for homotopic curves a, a' we have i ( a) = i ( a') , it follows that for 9 E Homeoo(']f2), Ag = I, the identity matrix in GL(2, Z). Therefore, the homomorphism 7} descends to a homomorphism H : MCQ(']f2) -t GL(2, Z). Below, we will verify that H is an isomorphism onto 8L(2, Z). As a first step, given a matrix A E 8L(2, Z), A=[: ], we construct a homeomorphism f = fA E Homeo(']f2) such that Af = A as follows: Recall the covering map p : }R2 -t ']f2 from Example 2.4.3 and consider the matrix A as a linear transformation of }R2.

Likewise, A maps vertical lines p-l(l) to lines of slope  and these project to simple closed curves (3 on 8 so that i (/3) = [  ] · We define a map I = I A : 1r 2 -+ 1r 2 as follows: Let x E 1r 2 and let x be a point in JR2 such that p(x) = x. Set I(x) = po A(x). You will verify in the exercises that the map I : 1r 2 -+ 1r 2 is well-defined and is a homeomorphism. By construction, i(f(l)) = [  ], i(f(m)) = [  ] · Therefore, AI = A. Note that, in the charts of 1r 2 implicitly defined by the covering map p, the Jacobian matrix of I is the matrix A. Thus, if A E 8L(2, Z), then I = I A is orientation-preserving. Therefore, it immediately follows that 8L(2, Z) C im(H). Furthermore, if A = Ag,g E Homeo(1r 2 ), then for I = lA, we obtain A = A I = Ag and, hence, the maps I A and 9 are isotopic to each other. Therefore, the map J: A r-+ [I A] E MCQ(1r 2 ) satisfies J 0 H = id . Hence, the homomorphism H is injective. It remains to show that im(H) C 8L(2,Z). Note that each diffeomorphism I = IA for which det(A) = -1 is orientation-reversing. Thus, if 9 E Homeo(1r 2 ) is such that det(Ag) = -1, then 9 is isotopic to the orientation-reversing diffeomorphism I = IA. Since an orientation-preserving diffeomorphism cannot be isotopic to an orientation-reversing one, it follows that for each 9 E Homeo+(1r 2 ), Ag E 8L(2, Z). This concludes the proof that H is an isomorphism MCQ(1r 2 ) -+ 8L(2, Z). D

50 2. Surfaces Remark 2.6.3. The reader familiar with homology will recognize that the map i defines coordinates on the homology group HI (1r 2 , Z), which is isomor- phic to Z2. Furthermore, A f is the marix of the automorphism of HI (1r 2 , Z) determined by f. A simple closed curve c in a surface S has a regular neighborhood (for the technical definition of regular neighborhood, see Appendix A). When c is orientation-preserving, this means that there is an embedding of an annulus f : SI x [0, 1]  S such that c = f(Sl x {1/2}) whose image is the regular neighborhood. The regular neighborhood can be taken to be open or closed. If it is open, we write 'lJ(c) (for f(SI x (0,1))); if it is closed, we write N(c) (for f(SI x [0, 1])). If c is orientation-reversing, an analogous statement holds with the annulus replaced by a Mobius band. Definition 2.6.4. Let c be an orientation-preserving simple closed curve in a compact surface S and let N(c) be a regular neighborhood of c that is oriented via the parametrization i : Sl x [0, 1]  'lJ(c). A map f : S  S is called a left Dehn twist around c if . fls\N(c) is the identity map; and . flN(c) is the map of the annulus given by f (e 2i1r (), t) = (e 2i1r «(}+t), t) V( e 2i1r (}, t) E Sl X [0, 1].

Likewise, a map f : S  S is called a right Dehn twist around c if . fIS\N(c) is the identity map; and . flN(c) is the map of the annulus given by f( e 2i1r (}, t) = (e 2i1r «(}-t), t) V( e 2i1r (}, t) E SI X [0, 1]. a , , , \ \ \ \ \ \ , f(a) Figure 2.24. Local effect of a left Dehn twist. We can think of a (left/right) Dehn twist as doing the following: cutting the surface along the core of the annulus, performing a full twist (to the left/to the right), and regluing. Theorem 2.6.5 shows that Dehn twists are the basic building blocks for all surface diffeomorphisms. Theorem 2.6.5 (Dehn, 1938; Lickorish, 1962). Every surface diffeomor- phism is isotopic to a composition of Dehn twists. In other words, the map- ping class group is generated by Dehn twists.

2.6. The Mapping Class Group 51 Theorem 2.6.5 was proved by M. Dehn and discussed in his Breslau Lectures in 1922. It was published in 1938; see [33]. The theorem was rediscovered (via a rather clever argument that we outline below) by W. B. R. Lickorish in 1962; see [88]. We will discuss some of the insights that go into the proof of this theorem. Lemma 2.6.6. If the simple closed curves a, (3 in the compact surface S intersect exactly once, then there is a pair fl, f2 of Dehn twists such that f2 · fl ( a) is isotopic to (3. Proof. If we choose fl to be a left Dehn twist along (3 and f2 to be a right Dehn twist along a, then indeed f2 · fl(o.) = (3. See Figures 2.25, 2.26, and 2.27. D  'ex Figure 2.25. a and (3.

If a, (3 are oriented simple closed curves in the orientable surface S, then there is a series of Dehn twists fl, f2, · · · , fk such that fk .. . .. f2 · fl (a) is either disjoint from (3 or intersects (3 in exactly two oppositely oriented points. Sketch of proof. The proof is by induction on the number of points in the intersection of the two curves. Suppose that there are two points of intersection with the same orientation that are adjacent along (3. See Figure 2.28. Then denote the subarc of a that connects these two points by c. By

After a small isotopy, this curve intersects a in exactly one point. Denote this curve by c. In Exercise 3 you will show that for 11 a right Dehn twist along c, 11 (a) has fewer points of intersection with (3 than a. If there are no points of intersection with the same orientation that are adjacent along (3 and if there are at least three points of intersection, then a similar construction allows a reduction of the number of points in a n (3.

A self-diffeomorphism of S takes this fixed collection of curves to another such collection of curves. Using Lemmas 2.6.6 and 2.6.7 allows us to perform a series of Dehn twists that reverses the effect of the surface diffeomorphism on the specified collection of curves.

An element of the mapping class group of S is reducible if it has a reducible representative. It is a deep theorem due to W. Thurston that elements of the map- ping class group are classified as being either periodic, reducible, or pseudo- Anosov.

Chapter 3 3- Manifolds One of our goals in this chapter is to discuss prime factorization of 3- manifolds. This prime factorization is almost unique, but the 2-sphere submanifolds of a 3-manifold M along which M decomposes can be po- sitioned in more than one way. We will also discuss other decompositions of 3-manifolds. For more on these subjects, see [63], [67], [71], [73], and [72]. In this chapter and beyond, we will assume familiarity with the con- cept of general position. For details, see Appendix A. One of the insights gleaned from general position is that compact 2-dimensional submanifolds of a 3-manifold M can always be isotoped slightly to intersect in a com- pact I-dimensional submanifold. See Figure 3.1. A compact I-dimensional submanifold and a compact 2-dimensional submanifold of M can always be isotoped slightly to intersect in a finite number of points. See Figure 3.2. Compact I-dimensional submanifolds of M can be isotoped to be disjoint. A point, i.e., a O-dimensional submanifold of M, can be assumed to be disjoint from 2-, 1-, or other O-dimensional submanifolds of M. -------------   --------------- Figure 3.1.

56 3. 3-Manifolds Figure 3.2. Local picture of general position for a 1-submanifold and a 2-submanifold of a 3-manifold. More generally, let M be an n-manifold containing a k-dimensional sub- manifold K and an l-dimensional submanifold L that are in general position. Then KnL is a (possibly empty) submanifold of M of dimension (k+l-n). Furthermore, general position can always be guaranteed and maintained by small isotopies. Convention 3.0.1. To simplify our statements, we will, in this section and beyond, make the assumption that, for k < n, a manifold of dimension k in a manifold of dimension n is a submanifold. In particular, simple closed curves and simple arcs lying in a surface or 3-manifold and surfaces lying in a 3-manifold are submanifolds. An interesting 2-sphere contained in JR3 that is not a submanifold in the sense defined in Chapter 1 was exhibited by J. W. Alexander. It is called the Alexander horned sphere. (For an artistic rendition, see for instance [127].) An interesting fact concerning the Alexander horned sphere is that it does not bound a 3-ba11. Convention 3.0.1 now eliminates this type of example from our discussion. 3.1. Bundles Recall two of the examples of surfaces with boundary discussed in Chapter 2: the annulus and the Mobius band.

58 3. 3-Manifolds Here M is called the total space, F is called the fiber, B is called the base space, and 1r is called the projection. A pair (U a , hoJ is called a bundle chart. The family {(U a, ha)} is called a bundle atlas. We sometimes refer to (M, F, B, 1r) simply as an F-bundle over B. In the context of 3-manifolds, we sometimes use the word fibering instead of bundle. Example 3.1.2. Any product manifold X x Y is a bundle. The total space is X x Y, the fiber is Y (or X, respectively), the base space is X (or Y, respectively), and the projection is projection onto the first (or second, respectively) factor. The annulus is an example of this type of bundle. Example 3.1.3. The Mobius band is a bundle with fiber I and base space SI. The projection can be described by considering the rectangle in Figure 3.5. The projection consists in vertical projection onto the core curve, that is, the marked curve. We leave it as an exercise to show that the map thus obtained is continuous, as required. Example 3.1.4. Let S be a closed connected n-manifold and f : S  S a homeomorphism. The mapping torus of f is the (n + I)-manifold obtained from S x [-1,1] by identifying the points (x, -1) and (f(x), 1), Yx E S. The mapping torus of f is a bundle with fiber S and base space SI. The total space is often denoted by (S x I) / "-J f . The role of the homeomorphism f in the above example is an interest- ing one. One crucial fact is that the isotopy class of this homeomorphism determines the (n + I)-manifold. The Mobius band is an example of a mapping torus, with S = [-1,1] and f : [-1, 1]  [-1,1] given by f(x) = -x. Definition 3.1.5. Suppose that (M, F, B, 1r) and (M', F, B', 1r') are bundles. An isomorphism between the bundles is a pair of homeomorphisms h : M  M' and f:BB' such that the following diagram commutes: M h) M' 1r 1 l 1r1 B f .) B' .

3.1. Bundles 59 We say that two bundles are isomorphic or equivalent if there is an isomorphism between them. The annulus and the Mobius band are inequivalent bundles. To see this, note, for instance, that the total space of the annulus has two boundary components whereas the total space of the Mobius band has only one. Thus there can be no bundle homeomorphism between the two. There is a more intuitive approach to understanding the difference be- tween the annulus and the Mobius band: Cut the total spaces along their core curves. The core curve of the annulus is marked in Figure 3.3; that of the Mobius band is marked in Figure 3.5. If we cut along the core curve of the annulus, we obtain two annuli. If we cut along the core curve of the Mobius band, we obtain only one annulus. Both the annulus and the Mobius band are I-bundles over the circle, in fact, they are the only two I-bundles over the circle. Example 3.1.6. The annulus and the Mobius band are inequivalent bun- dles. Definition 3.1.7. A bundle that is isomorphic to a product bundle is called a trivial bundle. A bundle that is not a trivial bundle is called a non-trivial bundle. Example 3.1.8. The annulus is a trivial bundle. The Mobius band is a non-trivial bundle. Definition 3.1.9. Given a bundle E = (M, F, B, 7r) and a submanifold B' of B, the restriction of E to B' is a bundle with total space M' = 7r- 1 (B'), fiber F, base space B', and projection 7rIM'. We denote this restriction by EIB'. Example 3.1.10. We construct a non-trivial I-bundle over the Mobius band as follows: Consider the rectangle in Figure 3.5. Points in the rectangle lie in [-1,1] x [-1,1]. To form the Mobius band, we identify (-1, x) with (1, -x). Now consider [-1, 1] x [-1, 1] x [-1, 1] and identify (-1, x, y) with (1, -x, -y). The result is a non-trivial bundle over the Mobius band. We leave it as an exercise to show that the total space of this bundle is a solid torus. See Figure 3.7. The above example can be visualized as follows: First we visualize the Mobius band. We start with a square and identify the left and right sides so that we obtain a non-trivial bundle over the core circle. We do so by stretching and bending the square so that the left and right sides of the square come up out of the page. We then twist the right side by 180 degrees and attach the two sides.

60 3. 3-Manifolds Figure 3.7. The solid torus containing the Mobius band. Now we visualize the non-trivial bundle over the Mobius band. We start with the trivial I-bundle over the square as in Figure 3.5. This is a cube. We identify the left and right sides of the cube so that we obtain a non- trivial bundle. We do so by stretching and bending the cube so that the two squares come up out of the page. We must identify these squares so that (if we put our head between the two and look to one side and then the other) the left side of one is identified to the left side of the other (and the right side of one to the right side of the other) and the top of one is identified to the bottom of the other. The trivial bundle Jm2 x Sl and the bundle in Example 3.1.10 are in- equivalent bundles. Their total spaces are homeomorphic, but their bundle structures differ. Definition 3.1.11. A section of a bundle is a continuous map a : B -t E such that 7r 0 a = idB (where idB is the identity map on B). For a comprehensive treatment of bundles, see [65] or [150]. Definition 3.1.12. Let M be an n-manifold. Let S be a submanifold of M of dimension m. A regular neighborhood of S is a sub manifold N(S) of M of dimension n that is the total space of a bundle over S with fiber Jmn-m. A regular neighborhood of a I-manifold in a 3-manifold is also called a tubular neighborhood. A regular neighborhood of an (n - I)-dimensional submanifold of an n-manifold that is a trivial bundle is also called a collar (or, if n = 2, a bicollar). An open regular neighborhood of S is a submanifold 'f}(S) of M of dimension n that is the total space of a bundle over S with fiber interior(Jmn-m).

In the exercises you will show that for simple closed curves there are only two possible total spaces for regular neighborhoods. In particular, if c is an orientation-preserving simple closed curve in an orientable 3-manifold M, then there is a solid torus, f : Sl x ]1))2 -t M, such that c = f(Sl X {(O, O)}), whose image is the regular neighborhood of c in M.

The following theorem summarizes results discussed in Appendix A. Theorem 3.1.13. Let M be an n-manifold and let S be a k-manifold in M. There exists a regular neighborhood N (S) for S in M. Furthermore, any two regular neighborhoods of S in M are isotopic. A related, but more specific, theorem is the following: Theorem 3.1.14. If S is a surface in the 3-manifold M and both M and S are orientable, then N(S) is a trivial I -bundle. Definition 3.1.15. Let S be a surface in the 3-manifold M. We say that S is a 2-sided surface if a regular neighborhood of S in M is a trivial I-bundle. We say that S is a I-sided surface if a regular neighborhood of S in M is a non-trivial, or twisted, I-bundle.

The Schonflies Theorem The Schonflies Theorem generalizes the Jordan Curve Theorem. One of the key notions in this context is Definition 3.2.1: Definition 3.2.1. A 3-manifold M is irreducible if every 2-sphere in M bounds a 3-ball. A 3-manifold is reducible if it contains a 2-sphere that does not bound a 3- ball. Example 3.2.2. The 3-manifold S2 x SI is reducible. Before stating and proving the Schonflies Theorem, we prove a lemma. We will use this lemma in the proof of the Schonflies Theorem. It will also serve as a warm-up for our discussion of 3-manifolds. Lemma 3.2.3. Let 81, 82 be surfaces in a 3-manifold M. Suppose that 81n82 contains a simple closed curve c such that, fori = 1,2, one component of 8 i \c is a disk D i such that D2 is disjoint from 8 1 . If c U Dl U D2 bounds a 3-ball in M, then . (81 \Dl) U D2 is isotopic to 81; . there is an isotopy of 8 1 that eliminates the curve c from 8 1 n 82 and introduces no new components of intersection. Note that we are considering 8 1 before and after the isotopy. It would make sense to write 8f to distinguish the positioning of 8 1 at various times during the isotopy, but this is usually unnecessary, as context makes it clear which positioning is meant. So we simply write 8 1 .

See Figure 3.10, where Dl is the disk above the xy-plane. To obtain the first conclusion, note that straight line projection of D 1 C 81 onto the xy-plane is an isotopy that replaces 81 with (81 \Dl) U D2. To obtain the second conclusion, note that straight line projection of the portion of 8 1 lying above y = -€ (this includes Dl) onto the plane y = -€ is an isotopy of 8 1 that eliminates the component c from 8 1 n 82. See Figure 3.11. D / / Figure 3.11. After the projection and isotopy. Definition 3.2.4. Let X be an n-manifold and x a subset of X (typically a submanifold of dimension n - 1). To cut X along x means to consider X\'fJ(x). Likewise, x cuts X into a given set of manifolds means that X\'fJ(x) consists of this set of manifolds. Theorem 3.2.5 (Schonflies Theorem). Any 2-sphere in 3 bounds a 3-ball. A beautiful elementary proof of this theorem was given by Morton Brown in 1960; see [18]. Students are encouraged to read this proof in the original.

64 3. 3-Manifolds some of the techniques employed in the contemporary study of 3-manifolds. It relies on the the Poincare- Hopf Index Theorem mentioned in Chapter 1. If you don't understand the proof below in its entirety on a first reading, focus on the intuition behind it and the point of view espoused. You will see the concepts and techniques used to prove this theorem over and over again. We are working in the DIFF category. We will use the concept of a "height function". A height function is a Morse function with at most two critical points, namely a maximum and a minimum. This is a strong requirement. In fact, there are only three connected 3-manifolds that admit height functions: S3 (requires a maximum and a minimum, by compactness), 1m 3 (requires a maximum and a minimum, by compactness), and 3 (requires no critical points). For more information on Morse functions, see Appendix B. We will also use induction on an ordered pair of numbers. Recall that induction can be performed on any countable ordered set. When we perform induction on an ordered pair of numbers, both entries must come from a countable ordered set. The product of the countable sets is countable and is ordered via the dictionary order. Proof. Let S C 3 be a 2-sphere submanifold. We isotope S so that the height function h : 3 -t  given by projection onto the third coordinate restricts to a Morse function his. By the Poincare-Hopf Index Theorem, #maxima + #minima - #saddles = X(S) = 2. Note that since S is compact, his has at least one maximum and one minimum. Let n be the number of saddle points. If n = 0, then S has one maximum, Y2, and one minimum, Yl. We may assume, by multiplying h with an appropriate constant, that Y2 - Yl = 2. We may further assume, by translating h upwards or downwards, that Y2 = 1 and hence Yl = -1. Each r such that -1 < r < 1 corresponds to a level curve in S that is a simple closed curve in the plane z = r. It follows from the Jordan Curve Theorem that each such curve can be isotoped within the plane z = r into the circle such that x 2 + y2 = 1 - r 2 . It is not too hard to see (though harder to prove rigorously) that these isotopies can be chosen so as to vary smoothly with r. Thus S is isotopic to the standard 2-sphere in 3 and hence bounds a 3- ball. Note that if n = 1, then there are two minima (or one minimum, resp.), one maximum (or two maxima, resp.), and one saddle. There are two pos- sibilities: a "non-nested" saddle or a "nested" saddle. See Figures 3.12 and 3.13. In either case, there is a plane z = c (containing the saddle) that meets

3.2. The SchonfJ.ies Theorem 65 8 in a figure 8. Call the plane H. Then H n 8 is a figure 8 that cuts 8 into three disks, DI, D2, D3. Each of these disks contains exactly one critical point (either a maximum or a minimum). Furthermore, the figure 8 cuts H into two disks and one unbounded component. At least one of these two disks, call it D, shares its boundary with one of D 1 , D2, D3. Attach aD to the boundary of the appropriate DI, D2, D3, say D 1 , to obtain a piecewise smooth 2-sphere D U DI. After a small isotopy (that introduces only one new critical point), DUDI has exactly two critical points (a maximum and a minimum). Since it has no saddles, the case above applies and it bounds a 3-ba11. By Lemma 3.2.3, (8\DI) U D is isotopic to 8. After a small isotopy, (8\DI) U D is smooth and has no saddles. Thus the situation reduces to the case n = O. H Figure 3.12. A sphere with one (non-nested) saddle. Figure 3.13. A sphere with one (nested) saddle. More generally, suppose that n > 2 and that every 2-sphere in 3 with less than n saddles bounds a 3-ball. Then there is a plane H', given by z = r, for a regular value r, such that there are saddle points both above and below H' and such that the number of components of H' n 8 is minimal. Denote the number of components of H' n 8 by #IH ' n 81. We argue by induction on (n, #IH ' n 81).

66 3. 3-Manifolds Here H' n 8 is a compact I-manifold (without boundary), so H' n 8 is a finite union of disjoint simple closed curves in H'. Let a be an innermost component of H' n 8 in H'. It follows that there is a disk D c H' that meets 8 only in a. Here a separates 8 into two disks, D 1 , D2. Set 8 1 = D U Dl and 8 2 = D U D2. Then both 81 and 82 are piecewise smooth 2-spheres in 3. We isotope 81 and 82 slightly (in a way that introduces only one new critical point) to be smooth. See Figures 3.14 and 3.15. H' Figure 3.14. A choice of a. H' Figure 3.15. The spheres 8 1 and 82. At least one of 8 1 ,82, say 82, has fewer saddles than 8 and hence bounds a 3-ba11. Thus by Lemma 3.2.3, 8 is isotopic to 8 1 . Note that 8 1 has no more saddles than 8 and, after a further isotopy as in Lemma 3.2.3, it has at least one fewer component of intersection with H'. (Note that the isotopies in Lemma 3.2.3 do not increase the number of saddles in 81.) Thus, by induction on (n, #IH ' n 81), 8 bounds a 3-ball. D Corollary 3.2.6. 3, 1m 3 , and S3 are irreducible.

3.2. The SchonfJ.ies Theorem 67 Proof. Let 8 be a 2-sphere submanifold in 3. The Schonflies Theorem tells us that 8 bounds a 3-ba11. Thus 3 is irreducible. Let 8' be a 2-sphere submanifold in the 3-ba11. 1m 3 is a subset of 3 that can be stretched (via an appropriate isotopy) to be arbitrarily large without stretching 8'. The proof of the Schonflies Theorem takes place in a compact subset of 3 and thus can be adapted to take place in 1m 3 . Hence 8' bounds a 3-ball in 1m 3 . Whence the 3-ball is irreducible. Finally, let 8" be a 2-sphere submanifold of S3. Here S3 = 3 U 00. We may assume, after an isotopy, that 8" misses 00; then 8" C 3 C S3. Thus the Schonflies Theorem furnishes a 3-ball bounded by 8" (in 3 C S3), whence S3 is irreducible. D We can say even more about S3: The 2-sphere 8" in S3 bounds a 3-ball to one side. If we remove a point (that we think of as 00) from the 3-ball bounded by 8", we can repeat the argument in the proof of Corollary 3.2.6. This produces another 3-ball bounded by 8"-to the other side! The ideas used in the proof of the Schonflies Theorem carryover to other settings. We prove Alexander's Theorem via an argument analogous to that used in the proof of the Schonflies Theorem. Theorem 3.2.7 (Alexander). Let T be a torus submanifold in S3, then one of the components ofS3\ T has closure homeomorphic to a solid torus SI x 1m 2 . We will use the notion of "co bounding". The manifolds Ll, . . . , Ln are .... .... said to cobound the manifold L if 8L = L 1 U · · · U Ln. For instance, below, we will see two simple closed curves in a surface that cobound an annulus. Proof. Let T C 3 be a torus submanifold. We isotope T so that the height function h : 3 --+  given by projection onto the third coordinate restricts to a Morse function hhr. By the Poincare-Hopf Index Theorem, #maxima + #minima - #saddles = X(T) = O. Denote the number of saddles by n. Note that since T is compact, it contains at least one maximum and one minimum. The Poincare-HopfIndex Theorem then implies that T has at least two saddles. If n = 2, then T has one maximum and one minimum. A level curve of hhr near the maximum bounds a disk in the corresponding level surface of h. At the first saddle, this disk is either (1) pinched into two disks (see Figure 3.16) or (2) turns into a pinched annulus (see Figure 3.17). Between the two saddles a level surface intersects T correspondingly either (1) in two non-nested circles bounding disks or (2) in two nested circles cobounding an annulus.

/*** Page =79= ***/
68 3. 3-Manifolds Below the second saddle (near the minimum), a level curve of hiT again bounds a single disk. Thus at the second saddle, either (1) the two non-nested circles bounding disks are wedged together or (2) the annulus is pinched. Figure 3.16. A pinching into two disks. Figure 3.17. Pinching into an annulus.

3.2. The Schonflies Theorem 69 In both cases, these disks and annuli stack on top of each other to form a solid torus. See Figure 3.18 for an illustration of option (1). Note that in option (2), there is already a solid torus (annulus) x I between the two saddles. fIIIII"...--...., fIIIII"...--...., Figure 3.18. Between the critical points. Suppose now that n > 3, and suppose that every torus in JR3 with less than n saddles bounds a solid torus. Choose a regular level surface H, given by z = r, such that there are saddle points both above and below Hand such that the number of components of H n 1r is minimal. We now argue by induction on (n, #IH n 1rD. Here H n 1r is a compact I-manifold (without boundary), so H n 1r is a finite union of disjoint simple closed curves in H. Let a be an innermost component of H n 1r in H. It follows that there is a disk D c H that meets S only in a. There are two cases: Case 1. a is separating in 1r. Let PI, P2 be the surfaces obtained by cutting 1r along a. Since x(Fi) is odd (an orientable surface with one boundary component), X(Pi) < 2, and X(PI) + X(P2) = X(1r) = 0, it must be the case that either PI or P2, say 
/*** End Page =80= ***/
/*** Page =81= ***/
70 3. 3-Manifolds PI, is a disk and that the other component, P2, is a punctured torus. We proceed as in the proof of the Schonflies Theorem: Set 8 1 = D U Pl. Then 8 1 is a piecewise smooth 2-sphere in JR3 that can be isotoped to be a smooth 2-sphere. It thus bounds a 3-ball. By Lemma 3.2.3, 1r is isotopic to (1r\Pl) U D. Now (1r\P l ) U D is a piecewise smooth torus with at most n saddles. It can be isotoped into a smooth torus with at most n saddles. By Lemma 3.2.3, (1r\Pl) UD can be isotoped to intersect H in one fewer level curve than 1rnH. (Note that the isotopies in Lemma 3.2.3 do not increase the number of saddles of (1r\P l ) U D.) Thus, by induction, (1r\Pl) U D and hence 1r bounds a solid torus. Case 2. a is non-separating in 1r. Here 1r\a is an annulus A. We may color the portion of this annulus that lies above H red and the portion that lies below H blue. Then every point in A is either colored red or colored blue or lies on one of the circles in H n 1r. Just above a, A is colored red. Just below a, A is colored blue. Thus there must be at least one other component a' of H n 1r that is non- separating in 1r. We may assume that a' is innermost in H. Indeed, if it is not, then it bounds a disk D containing other components of 1r n H; if an innermost component of 1r n H in D is separating, proceed as in Case 1; if an innermost component of 1r n H in iJ is non-separating, replace a' with this component. Now 1r\(a U a') consists of two annuli AI, A 2 . Denote the disk in H\1r bounded by a by D and that bounded by a' by D'. Set 8 1 = Al U DUD' and 82 = A2 U DUD'. Both 8 1 and 8 2 are piecewise smooth 2-spheres. Thus each of them bounds a 3-ball on either side. Two of these 3-balls can be identified along D and D' to form a solid torus. D The following notion is related to irreducibility for manifolds with non- empty boundary. Definition 3.2.8. A 3-manifold M is boundary irreducible if every simple closed curve c in 8M that bounds a disk in M cuts M into two 3-manifolds one of which is a 3-ba11. Example 3.2.9. A boundaryless 3-manifold is necessarily boundary irre- ducible. Example 3.2.10. The 3-ball is boundary irreducible. The solid torus V = Sl xJI))2 is not boundary irreducible. Indeed, consider the curve m = {p} X 8JI))2 C 8V. Then m is non-separating in 8V; hence the disk D = {p} X JI))2 is also non-separating.

3.3. 3-Manifolds that are Prime but Reducible 71 Definition 3.2.11. For V, m, D as above, m is called a meridian and D is called a meridian disk. A simple closed curve in 8V that intersects m in one point is called a longitude. Exercises Exercise 1. Alexander's Theorem does not generalize to surfaces of genus greater than or equal to 2, in the sense that not every connected orient able 2-dimensional submanifold of S3 is the boundary of a regular neighborhood of a graph in S3. To convince yourself of this, draw a picture of a piecewise smooth closed orient able surface S of genus 2 in S3 so that neither component of S3\S is a regular neighborhood of a graph in S3. xercise 2*. Let ill be a covering space of a 3-manifold M. Prove that M is irreducible only if M is irreducible. (The converse is true but is more difficult to prove.) Exercise 3. Use Exercise 2 to deduce that the 3-torus 1f3 is irreducible. Exercise 4. Prove that the solid torus is irreducible. 3.3. 3-Manifolds that are Prime but Reducible There are two compact connected 3-manifolds that deserve attention in the context of prime and reducible 3-manifolds. These two 3-manifolds are both S2-bundles over Sl. In fact, they are both mapping tori with S = S2. One of these 3-manifolds is the product manifold S2 x Sl (= (S2 X 1)/ r-Jid s 2). The other is also an (albeit twisted) mapping torus over S2. Definition 3.3.1. We denote by S2 x Sl the 3-manifold (S2 x 1)/ ""'I where f : S2 -t S2 is the antipodal map. We also call S2 xS l the twisted product of S2 over Sl. We already discussed separating and non-separating simple closed curves in surfaces. The more general definition is analogous: Definition 3.3.2. A submanifold A of a connected manifold X is separating if X\A has at least two components; otherwise it is non-separating. Remark 3.3.3. Connected manifolds are path connected. It follows that a submanifold A of a connected manifold X is non-separating if and only if there is a simple closed curve in X that intersects A transversely in a single point. Moreover, it follows that a submanifold A of a connected manifold X is non-separating if and only if there is a simple closed curve in X that intersects A transversely in an odd number of points.

72 3. 3-Manifolds The 3-manifolds S2 x Sl and S2 xS l contain non-separating 2-spheres. Theorem 3.3.4 below shows that this is a rare property. The proofs of many theorems in low-dimensional topology, and Theorem 3.3.4 is no exception, rely on the existence of regular neighborhoods. For more details see Appen- dix A. Theorem 3.3.4. An irreducible closed connected 3-manifold is prime. An orientable closed connected prime 3-manifold is either irreducible or S2 x Sl . Remark 3.3.5. More generally, a closed connected prime 3-manifold is either irreducible or S2 x S10r S2 xS 1 , but we will not prove this fact here. Proof. A non-trivial connected sum of 3-manifolds contains a sphere that does not bound a 3-ba11. Hence an irreducible 3-manifold is prime. Suppose M is prime and let S be a 2-sphere in M. If S is separating, then M - S has two components, N 1 , N2. If neither N 1 nor N2 is a 3-ball, then M = N 1 #N2 and M is not prime. Thus either N 1 or N2 is a 3-ball; Le., S bounds a 3-ba11. If S is non-separating, let a be a simple closed curve in M that intersects S once transversely. Furthermore, let N(S) be a regular neighborhood of S in M and let N(a) be a regular neighborhood of a. Both N(a) and N(S) are trivial I-bundles, so, in particular, 8N(S) consists of two copies of S. TI.ansversality of S and a guarantees that N ( a) intersects N (S) in a solid cylinder. Let M be the submanifold of M obtained by removing the interior of N(S) U N(a). Then 8M is a 2-sphere S in M. Moreover, S is a separating 2-sphere. To one side of S is N(S) U N(a). Hence there must be a 3-ball to the other side of S. Therefore M = N(S) U N(a) U (3-ball) = S2 x Sl. D In Section 5.5, we will prove that prime decompositions of 3-manifolds exist and that they satisfy an appropriately defined notion of uniqueness. Exercises Exercise 1. Construct a 2-to-l covering map from S2 x Sl to S2 xS l . Exercise 2. Consider the connected sum of 1f3 and S2 x Sl. How many non-isotopic 2-spheres decompose this manifold as a connected sum? Exercise 3. Show that S2 xS l is non-orientable. 3.4. Incompressible Surfaces In the study of surfaces, essential simple closed curves lying on the surface play an important role. They allow for the use of cut and paste techniques

3.4. Incompressible Surfaces 73 that suffice to classify surfaces. It is natural to try to proceed analogously in higher dimensions. This line of investigation has been pursued with a certain amount of success. We discuss the results in Chapter 5. Some surfaces contained in a 3-manifold are more interesting than others. We here discuss one useful class of surfaces. This class of surfaces can be thought of as a generalization of the notion of "essential simple closed curve" in a 2-manifold. Definition 3.4.1. A submanifold 8 in a compact n-manifold M is proper if 88 = 8 n 8M. Convention 3.4.2. In what follows we will assume that a submanifold 8 of M is proper and write simply 8 (contained) in M or 8 c M, unless 88 is explicitly said to lie elsewhere. inessential arc essential arc boundary Figure 3.19. An inessential arc and an essential arc in the punctured torus. Definition 3.4.3. A simple arc a in a surface F is essential if there is no simple arc (3 in 8F such that aU(3 is a closed I-manifold that bounds a disk in F. See Figure 3.19. Definition 3.4.4. Let M be a 3-manifold. A surface 8 in M is compressible if either . 8 is a 2-sphere bounding a 3- ball in M or . there is a simple closed curve c in 8 that bounds a disk D with interior in M\8 but that bounds no disk with interior a component of 8\ c. A surface that is not compressible is called incompressible. See Figures 3.20, 3.21, and 3.22. The disk D is called a compressing disk for 8, or simply a compressing disk if the context is clear. Example 3.4.5. If the surface 8 C 1m 3 is incompressible, then 8 is a union of disks. Indeed, each component of 88 is a simple closed curve in 81m 3 . Such a curve bounds a disk to either side in 81m 3 and hence bounds a disk

A boundary compressing disk. Definition 3.4.7. Let M be a connected 3-manifold. A 2-sphere S c M is essential if it does not bound a 3-ball. A surface F c M is boundary parallel if it is separating and a component of M\F is homeomorphic to F x I. A surface F in a 3-manifold M is essential if it is incompressible, boundary incompressible, and not boundary parallel. The following definition honors Wolfgang Haken, who pioneered the study of incompressible surfaces in 3-manifolds via a machinery we will dis- cuss in Chapter 5. Definition 3.4.8. An orientable irreducible 3-manifold that contains a proper essential surface is called a Haken 3-manifold. Remark 3.4.9. In subsequent sections and chapters we will always assume, unless stated otherwise, that submanifolds are proper. Exercises Exercise 1. Prove that the 2-torus in 1f3 pictured in Figure 3.22 is incom- pressible. Exercise 2. Prove that a torus in S3 is necessarily compressible. Exercise 3. Suppose that F is a surface and 4J is a homeomorphism of F. Show that each copy F x {point} of F in the mapping torus of 4J is incompressible. Exercise 4*. Show that there are no closed incompressible surfaces in ]ffi3 or S3. (Hint: Adapt the proof of Alexander's Theorem.) 3.5. Dehn's Lemma* Max Dehn was among the first to investigate knots with a view towards 3-manifolds. One of his aims was to answer a fundamental question in knot theory that we will encounter again in Chapter 4: how to decide whether or not a given simple closed curve in S3 bounds a disk.

This book grew out of a graduate course on 3-manifolds and is intended for a math- ematically experienced audience that is new to low-dimensional topology. The exposition begins with the definition of a manifold, explores possible additional structures on manifolds, discusses the classification of surfaces, introduces key foun- dational results for 3-manifolds, and provides an overview of knot theory. It then continues with more specialized topics by briefly considering triangulations of 3-manifolds, normal surface theory, and Heegaard splittings. The book finishes with a discussion of topics relevant to viewing 3-manifolds via the curve complex. With about 250 figures and more than 200 exercises, this book can serve as an excel- lent overview and starting point for the study of 3-manifolds.
